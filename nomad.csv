Abbvie,1c2n8pqem5n8qbgr,3,Starting to become like big pharma instead of biotech,"Territory Manager, Immunology",Micro-management for biotech\r Too many programs that weren't necessarily contributing to medical education.\r Many failures in the pipeline.\r Seemed like they were favoring a younger sales force instead of seasoned with experience.
Abbvie,1fl6hh7c7n5co802,1,Good Pay but Toxic,Customer Service Representative,Run quickly. All money not good money and you will spend most of it if you work in Pharmacy Solutions for medical care and treatment.Very toxic work environment with toxic managers and supervisors.
Abbvie,1fknstus9sa8i800,5,"Progressive, offers great training, leadership, It is a very inclusive workplace",Executive Assistant,"This is the best company in my 35 yr career.  I feel that most people are very successful, talented and really care about every aspect of their job.  Management is exceptional and is willing to go all the way for their team."
Abbvie,1fknrks2nu20t802,3,They bought us and all went south,Manager,"Allergan was great, then Abbvie came to town with lots of demands but little to no plan. As usual with a buyout, the lesser company got squeezed for everything they had, driving production numbers while reducing budget. I didn't like the new management so hit the road. "
Abbvie,1fjjknhhhu1am802,5,"Good, solid company. Lots of opportunities. ",Human Resources Generalist,"Just like any large company, has its share of negatives and bureaucracy. Lots of great people and room to grow. Work/life balance can be a challenge. "
Abbvie,1fiqrt5m0u270802,3,Great Benefits,Paralegal,If you're looking for stability and great benefits then AbbVie is a great place to work. They have a pension! There was little room for growth in my department.
Abbvie,1fie0abko3o7j002,2,Lately has become very autocratic management,Director IT,Used to be a great company to work for. Leadership changes in IT in last 3-4 years has maligned the culture of the company. It has become autocratic management way of working. 
Abbvie,1fi2mq75uu1ns801,5,Great place to work,Tech,"The job can be stressful at times, but we always accomplish our deadlines with the help of staff. This job requires good documentation skills and alertness. Learned a lot of new things working for fermentation and proper PPE to wear with different chemicals. With a great trainer, things can run smoothly. Unfortunately, some trainers arent always the best, but taking notes always helps."
Abbvie,1fi0tuo1jsa0n800,1,Poor enviroment,Quality Assurance Specialist,Abbvie does not allow the professional development and also either recognize the commitment/ preparation of its employees. The continual improvement and lean manufacturing does not exist.
Abbvie,1fi0gnarin52s800,4,"Meaningful work, not enough recognition",Project Information Manager,"The work is very meaningful, but decisions are often made without the right stakeholders or team members even being included. The company preaches innovation but internal bureaucracy often hinders it. Your manager has little say in terms of whether you get promoted. HR will block it if they don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the role long enough, even if you meet the promotion\xe2\x80\x99s job description. Although if you suck up to the right VPs, you can get whatever you want. Very patient centric company that is always focusing on improving culture though. Good leaders who look for long term company stability. "
Abbvie,1fh9qet2po2id800,3,The most average big pharma ,Sr. Scientist,"Great place if you want to chill out, but you are not learning much.  No innovation, just a bunch of ""me, too"" drugs. Compensation is not great.  Average salary, no stock program for entry level scientist.  No ESPP.  5% 401K matching.  No other benefits. "
Abbvie,1fh673h59t49t802,3,Nice place to work,Insurance Specialist I,Friendly ppl training was not so good had to learn a lot on your own. Overall it is a great company though. It is hard to get a full time position here though.
Abbvie,1fgaommlnsa1l800,2,Only work here if you are offered a full time employee position,Contractor/Chemist,"This contracting experience was honestly the worst I have ever went through. I was told that contractors would have an easier time getting a full time position because they got their foot in the door. But no. I joined and a few months later they said there is a hiring freeze through 2023. Full time employees there take breakfast and lunch breaks and coffee breaks throughout the day. They really only have to work a few hours since they put all the work on contractors. In just a few months, an older employee hit on me and my supervisor said degrading things about me to my face and my superiors. I went to hr after my supervisor tried to physically intimidate me. Hr did a great job. They were able to keep both employees away from me until I left. "
Abbvie,1ffq3diqku412802,3,Total Boys Club,Administrative Assistant,"Unless you're friends with Upper Mgmt, you will go nowhere.  The admin culture at AbbVie is incredibly clicky, hypocritical and two-faced.  Don't bother complaining to mgmt, they don't care.  There are rules for you, and then there are rules for everyone else - and they are very different!"
Abbvie,1fe1e5u503od8002,1,They took the one positive they had and flushed it.  The Pension.,Scientist I,"Salaried employees are expected to work well past a typical 40hr week.  Severely understaffed in expertise to do the job.  Leaving those of us with experience to pick up the slack.  Typical work week 60-70 hours average which turns the nice salary to being severely under paid.Contractors are run into the ground until they leave, taking more rss away from fte's to train new ppl.  It's a revolving door and you don't get hired."
Abbvie,1fdt5cc2p3od8000,3,Roller coaster ride,Systems Engineer,"Job can be boringly slow at times, but when busy, it is overwhelmingly chaotic.  Great benefits and pay, but can take a while to get to reasonable level.   In general, a good work/life balance.  "
Abbvie,1fdmpurpanq1d802,5,Great company. Extra things for the employees all the time ,Packaging Operator,"Great place to work. Always doing nice things for the employees. Picnics, raffles, breakfast. Giving away mugs, tee shirts, back packs, etc. Great company to work for. "
Abbvie,1fdkd4v0vu29d802,1,Departments take zero responsibility for their own job and pass work to others to do ,Senior Writer/Editor,"Many people have quit - and are still quitting-mass exodus. They keep on doing employee surveys cuz they know something\xe2\x80\x99s wrong. We tell them but they don\xe2\x80\x99t change anything. People left and got other jobs This is why: No accountability for other departments who constantly pass the baton to you to do their job. This is BIG part of culture here When you tell your manager about it, INSTEAD  of your manager making other departments accountable for their own jobs, you are told to just do other people\xe2\x80\x99s work to not rock the boat. Like the managers are even intimidated to talk to other departments and therefore enable this stuff! That says a lot about even the culture for management . Are they not allowed to speak up too? What\xe2\x80\x99s all that about?Zero empowerment- like trying to beat you into submission, probably to convince you that you will never be good enough to go anywhere else to work Convoluted ridiculous time consuming internal procedures where you can spend literally days  on end trying to sort through it all just to find  out what to do or how to do something because god forbid you ask someone how So I left. I had to get out - like many others. Stress was not worth it. My kids noticed too. This place is run by dinosaurs in twilight zone who rather let their direct teports do work beyond their scope (aka other people\xe2\x80\x99s work) instead of getting other depts off their back. My boss was supersurprized when I said I quit  because I just put up with it all. It\xe2\x80\x99s ironic cuz I told my boss how I felt all along. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be fooled by all the marketing stuff- this place is not"
Abbvie,1fcj3v7jst52g800,5,Excelente.,Pharmaceutical Operator I Spectraforce,Me siento muy feliz de haber trabajado en Abbvie y espero regresar nuevamente con ellos.
Abbvie,1fcf8vp79u4nb800,2,Stay away from operator positions!,Biologics Operator II,"I would guess for some people this could be a great place to work, but for Biologics Operator is a nightmare. Only eight free weekends a year. Management could not be more clueless about the operation and could not care less for Operators work life balance. Compensation and raises are mediocre at best. Stay Away!"
Abbvie,1fag4imlet4lp802,5,Great work culture and collaboration,IT Help Desk Analyst,"I got a a chance to help others, with the comradery of a strong team-oriented environment. With fair compensation and respect shared among others, I have no real complaints. Would recommend.   "
Abbvie,1fafg661uu2hu800,2,See below,PSS,"It was good until we started making too much money then they changed up the rules an it continued to change up WEEKLY., and was not transparent until AFTER you lost bonuses each month. There is so much to say, but I don't want to bring back bad memories in my mind."
Abbvie,1fa67lu43s7io800,5,Great Company Overall and looking to expand!,Accounting Lead,I worked in Abbvie in Puerto Rico and in Headquarters in Illinois. Great environment. People are always wiling to help. During COVID-19 they do a great job. I was working remotely for year and half. I left the company because of family matters and I moved from IL.  A company that you can be there for a while.
Abbvie,1f947h6vbo26d801,5,Very friendl5 helpful coworkers ,Executive Assistant,This was the first temp job of this caliber I had taken.7 was very impressed with myself with the 3ase I learned their policies and travel/expense system
Abbvie,1f8rdvephs9u0800,3,No work life balance.,Contractor,"Abbvie is a great company for benefits (besides some recent benefit changes). However, there is no work/life balance. You are expected to work ridiculous periods of overtime due to understaffing. Moving up shifts is supposed to be seniority based but recently it's all who you know. There is a high turnover rate with the contractors because of communication. Contractor's aren't told about the possible shift changes, extended hours, lack of being hired in etc... Not everyone can afford to remain a contractor with no health insurance. It just isnt realistic. We are real people who leave real permanent jobs for the chance of being a hired Abbvie employee, so when we find out there are hiring freezes it is a punch to the gut after leaving permanent work with full benefits. The schedule changes can put a strain on your personal life, but Abbvie doesnt seem to care about that. The Administrators who decide these schedule changes do not have to adhere to the changes themselves, so it doesn't affect them. Unfortunately, these issues will cause more great employees to leave and moral to keep going down. "
Abbvie,1f7vh1q48u1m4800,5,Good place to work,Workforce Analyst,Good company to work. Good work life balance and great manager. The location is far from Chicago hence you'll find less people in Waukegan. I'd prefer to travel.
Abbvie,1f7god0idu2ud800,1,Terrible place to work,Fermentation Operator,"Management does not care about their employees. They will run you into the ground until the wheels fall off as long as you keep pushing out product and making them money. Everyone on shift is mentally and physically exhausted. Despite the fact that we are severely undermanned, upper management continues to increase our workload. Overtime is mandatory every single week just to keep the place running with some operators covering two or more jobs. Unless you can stomach not having a personal life at all for the benefits they provide don't even bother."
Abbvie,1f7csvhu3u2ud800,5,Great place to work,Medical Safety Specialist,I had the best management team when I worked in the PDI Department. My managers always were looking out for me and supported all my decisions.  Constructive criticism was provided with care. Benefits amazing.  Great place to work.
Abbvie,1f7aegml3u26j800,1,Disappointed ,Contractor,"I joined not too long ago. Disappointed with poor company culture and very old school management style. They like to see you sitting on your desk, say yes to all managers request, follow their rules and play their games. They call new inventions as \xe2\x80\x9csuperficial\xe2\x80\x9d. They live in the 1920s basically. They force people to work in the office. No flexibility at all. Besides the good benefits and fare pay, nothing else is good.  "
Abbvie,1f74n0jv13obs000,1,AP16 2nd shift employee 1 year service,production blister ,Working at AbbVie was one of the hardest yet easy job there is. When i became an employee my work had increased and yet my co workers attitude had changed over time. They see you as a expendable employee. one who will work a tons of hours and be mistreated only to get the job done on time. My stress was over the roof and finally i quit. i worked 2nd shift. although  the pay was good I used this reason specifically to pay some debt I owned.one warning you should take it by heart is that This place wont treat you fairly even thought your by the compony there's always drama on the floor. issues to be dealt regarding lazy people not following orders. Ap16 managers are always constantly changing since they get promoted every 2 years. working on the medical company's all my life some will treat you like a family in my experience this isn't it even thought they have a banner and all. 
Abbvie,1f6stb39nhijp800,4,Good Pay and Pension but lots of silly busy work,Specialty Representative,"It's great to have a pension, but you could probably make more money elsewhere and come out ahead, which is not to say it pays poorly.  It pays well, but not top of biotech.  "
Abbvie,1f6lruoavn5f6800,5,Culture ,Scientist,Everyone at abbvie is brilliant and they work so hard and are always so happy. It's a good environment if you have a certain mindset. Be a team player. 
Abbvie,1f6ik81hpu1pa800,4,Overall Good,Associate Director Learning, There is a lot of hard work and people work many more then 40 hours a week. Leadership can be a bit micro managing and there is a definite hierarchy in at least my organization. 
Abbvie,1f617pad8u3n3800,3,A decent company but you will hate working there ,Maintenance Supervisor,The work culture is horrible. You grind day in and day out. The employees are miserable and it comes out in every day work days. The manager I had was probably the least ethical person I had ever met. It\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a who you know not what you know company
Abbvie,1f5m4ulnru3af800,4,Intern,Intern,"Remote intern - great team, helpful mentors, but because we were not able to go into the lab during the summer of 2020, the project was a little boring as it didn't involve any experimentation"
Abbvie,1f5gpqk7uu2n1800,4,Productive high paced highly visible activities,Senior Project Manager (Consultant) - through SGS Consulting,Work days vary due to global sites and time zones. I've learned many details about the pharma industry and continue to grow in the space. Management is thin but provide guidance and solid team to work with. The hardest part of the job as a PM is keeping budgets (financials are challenging - monthly time reporting not aligned with invoice calendar dates). It has gotten significantly better (5 sources of truth down to 2) but the process seems to work. The most enjoyable part of this assignment is colleague comradery. I've made many friends over the past 2 years.
Abbvie,1f3deitffu3dj800,5,Good company but contractors don’t have a secure job ,Clinical Drug Supply Associate I,Contractors don\xe2\x80\x99t have a secure job but overall company is a good one to work for and pays well for the work that is done.  Management is fair and you feel valued 
Abbvie,1f373valuu1v3800,5,Good company,GMP Production Specialist,Good company. Professional environment. Great workplace culture. Good management. Excellent coworkers. Good trainings. Excellent benefits for regular employees.
Abbvie,1f31jvcnhu1v3800,3,Benefits ,Finishing specialist,"Good company but management dont care about people who been there for years, better hourly pay for a new employees and contractors but for who been there for years no recognition"
Abbvie,1f2sd7l97u1v3800,4,Great pay and work/life balance,Intern,"Good place to work and would recommend overall. Great pay, perks, and work/life balance. Big emphasis on safety. A bit political like most large corporations. "
Abbvie,1f10aq0ert4l2800,4,Decent workplace with great pay,Finance Development Program,Overall AbbVie is a good place to work. Some of the managers are really good and others are not the best. If you are a member of the Finance Development Program they take good care of you and provide development opportunities and career advancement! 
Abbvie,1f01ma662u3jt800,4,Excellent Industry Leader & Employer!,Project Manager,"VERY proud to be an 11+ year employee of Abbvie.  As industry leaders they promote fairness, diversity, and an open commitment to not only the primary needs and focus of their patients, but also of their people.  Abbvie's continued focus towards diversity and inclusion is exceptional and they consistently raise the bar as an employer and example to follow in the Pharma industry."
Abbvie,1evuounn5u1sg800,4,Lots of Ego,Contract Project Manager,"This company has a lots of smart people working for it. However, this seems to cause a lot of ego and less collaborative environment. People speak over each other and are always late to meetings. Management doesn\xe2\x80\x99t read email and complain they did not know about things. On the plus side they are flexible with schedules and provide necessary resources."
Abbvie,1eu1admrbt48m800,4,Innovative,Program Manager Consultant,"This organization is always seeking to be an innovative leader in its industry, as a result, there is never a dull moment. If you like to work on fun projects where you are always thinking on your feet this is the place for you. There is also room for you to be a game-changer there through being innovative in your role to improve your teams' outcomes or the organizational outcomes. "
Abbvie,1etqeb5tlu221800,2,"Waco TX Production plant, poor leadership",Lead Technician,"People in QA treat everyone like they intentionally do things wrong. Batch records are overly complicated. Management only cares about production counts. Line workers are not paid enough to take pride in their work. Equipment mechanics are not properly trained, nor have the recourses to fix old equipment. Few people there have ever worked in the pharma industry else where and think their way is the right way. "
Abbvie,1etqa4na9u221800,4,"Good place to work, good pay",Sr. Manufacturing Supervisor,I have worked for 7 years now and have been working in different roles related with the manufacturing area. They do not know what is work and life balance however they provide a good pay. Peers and coworkers are great and have knowledge on what they do. Ambient is great and sometimes a little stressful Overall it is a good place to work and good benefits.
Abbvie,1etjl687bu312800,3,Poor talent retention,Pharmacovigilance Specialist,"The company does a great job providing resources for employees to develop, but does a poor job promoting their talent or being proactive about putting the employee in a position to succeed."
Abbvie,1et75fjsfpi26800,3,Good place to work if you're okay with less pay,Data Scientist,"Innovative work with definite impact. AbbVie is big pharma and has all of the major resources. Work-Life Balance is amazing and there are recreational activities as well. Management for the most part is good. However, AbbVie is not inclusive of people who are non-citizens and those who require sponsorship. The pay is below average."
Abbvie,1esim01mlu3cn800,1,Terrible!,Pharmacy Solutions,"Terrible! Poor management, they hire friends and only promote friends. They prefer contractors vs employees, and will push people out. Most supervisors are unprofessional"
Abbvie,1ertpf6g8s7mj800,4,Good place with good pay and retirement,Calibration  Coordinator,"It's a very good company to work for with great benefits and a lot of work.Expect to work a lot with high stress and a lot of training. You are not here to make friends but to work and respect your coworkers. Work hard play hard, this place will reward you in the long run. This is probably a better place to work than most companies out there. "
Abbvie,1eq6lieneu49m800,4,Productive and fun place to work at but poor compensation,Supply Chain and Reliability Engineering Co-op,"It's a growing company and you will learn a lot as far as the entire bioprocess operations are concerned. The culture is amazing, people are friendly and respectable. They need to work on their management and have a better onboarding process."
Abbvie,1ep3un8l2t4h0800,3,Highly political environment and club.,Associate Director,"Highly political environment, you need to be best buddies with Director level or higher,They will reward their friends and give bad reviews for others"
Abbvie,1eo8vptbbu2no800,5,Remote internship ,Intern,"Worked with the cell culture team to optimize sample information entry into barcodes that were in a printable and human-readable format Diverse work culture, helped me with all my doubts "
Abbvie,1elrqibj4u2u5800,4,Great place to work,Manufacturing Technician II,"Abbvie is a strong, rewarding company to work for. Promotion system is not difficult. Many different sports teams, clubs and events to participate in after work and most are company paid."
Abbvie,1elmfnrqju2j4800,5,Productive and Encouraging ,Ambassador,I have enjoyed this new role. It is challenging and competitive but not toxic. Management is very hands on and a learning environment is encouraged highly. Lots of feedback on how to succeed. This company invests a lot of time training and mentoring their new staff. 
Abbvie,1ekms3k5gu1qi800,1,Poor management,Executive Sales Representative,The culture of the company is to not look out for their people. District managers bully representatives into uncomfortable tasks.  it\xe2\x80\x99s good pay if you can handle the additional undue stress placed upon yourself
Abbvie,1ekepr54b3oh3000,5,Productive workplace,"Middleware Engineer, Infrastructure Specialist","Very large but very good company, work life balance was at times challenging. Great coworkers, management was for the most part very encouraging to workers"
Abbvie,1ekenb3j1o2hc800,5,Great,"Territory Manager, Cardiology and Metabolic Specialty Sales, Rochester, NY",Abbvie is a great place to work! I learned a lot from working there and if given the opportunity I would go back to work for them. Abbive has built a a wonderful culture 
Abbvie,1ekdf9jq6u3t5800,1,Just Walk Away. It’s Not Worth It.,Patient Care Coordinator,Abbvie is the most unprofessional and disrespectful workplace I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever experienced. The leadership team has been nothing but condescending and careless during the COVID-19 outbreak. Work from home was immediately enforced on all agents once the pandemic hit however new hires were forced to stay in the office and perform tasks not associated with the job they were initially hired for all while be put at high risk of a serious virus. You can expect to always be wrong even when your right and your job performance is never going to be good enough since there\xe2\x80\x99s always room for improvement. Favoritism is so ridiculously obvious in this workplace and if you wanna move up within the company you gotta be willing to suck up to management and throw your peers under the bus. I\xe2\x80\x99ve witnessed agents walk out during the middle of their shifts because of the amount of work and stress they force on their employees is just not worth the long mandatory hours. They do not care about their agents and if they decide to hire you they will not care about you. I truly regret accepting this position and once I get out I will be walking away and never looking back.
Abbvie,1ek4dafc33o71000,1,Not a good place for work,Lab Technician II,"Not a very pleasant place to work. If you are not friendly with the manager, you won\xe2\x80\x99t get recognized.  They only give opportunities to their preferred employees. "
Abbvie,1eju6h6uhu1i6800,5,Great Culture ,Technician,I worked at Abbvie for three years. I had to leave because my husband was in the military. Benefits were second to none. Location wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that great but oh well.
Abbvie,1ejt3u6feu2v7800,5,An awesome place to be,Contracted Graphic Designer,I worked here as a contracted UI/UX Designer and general purpose graphic designer and I loved it! My time working there I learned so much along with making alot of connections.
Abbvie,1ejic3i5lu1l6800,2,Its a company were a select group controll the enviorment.,Sales Representative,Not a good place to work. They have a small group of friends that get all the credit. Hostail work enviorment. The awards are a hoax; it is an exuse to give lavish trips for the mannagers and thier friends.
Abbvie,1ej1eq1sqsqbl800,2,Patchwork Culture,Senior Manager,"AbbVie tries to present itself as an inclusive company with a strong culture, that may be true for some working groups but many have a toxic, unsupportive and limiting culture.  Insiders blames this on \xe2\x80\x9cLegacy Abbott\xe2\x80\x9d personnel, but since poor behavior is not corrected it persist and therefore it is ultimatley AbbVie\xe2\x80\x99s fault that it is accepted.  Overall it is a good company due to its good benefits and strong science, but if you find your self looking a job here ask a lot of questions about culture to make sure that the job is on a team that values culture and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just repeat the corporate script."
Abbvie,1eiffhagcocr4800,5,"Great company culture, very rewarding",Associate Medical Director,"I enjoy working at AbbVie. Team spirit and company culture is strong, and everyone is in it for the right reasons. The science is solid and people overall bring their best every day. "
Abbvie,1ei900iatof3u800,5,Productively and Team members Oriented ,Scientist (Contractor),"The best company Job Work / life Balance is at Jayuya site. this site has been very helpful for Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing of Synthroid dose for the Word of Healthcare, and during the period of time I was working on the production transfer to Barceloneta sites. Reviewing Documentation and Protocols for Validations Processes are aligned with corporations Guidelines'."
Abbvie,1eh66brcprasm800,5,"Great place to work, very research focused environment",Experiential Graduate Intern (DMPK-TM),AbbVie is a great place to work. I worked there as a summer intern and liked very much. Very research focused environment and very helpful people. Great orientation.
Abbvie,1ef3a4jhloe9o800,5,"Great workplace, serious business.",DC Operations PM,Great place to work. I was lucky to be a part of an excellent team. Everyone in my team and people I need to work with are very knowledgeable and professional. This makes it easier to get things done.
Abbvie,1eef3fu4vrmhb800,2,Na,Regulatory Affairs Associate I,Management is terrible. Racial injustice overall. You will stay a contractor for as long as you please unless you fake to be social with everyone then you might become an employee. As a contractor you are treated very poorly unless you get a good group which can be hard.
Abbvie,1eebns1vjrmja800,3,Not very pleasant work environment.,Senior GTS Consultant,Upper management needs to take interest at lower level and should review the work culture in the company.\rThere should be strict policies for Abbvie employees behavior and code of conduct.\rEmployees should have fear that they have to pay price if they misconduct.
Abbvie,1ee19gulssemq800,4,Good place to gain knowledge,IT Compliance Analyst,management is good and work culture is good. All collegues are friendly  and supportive. New  technology can be learned and intense training. Some challenges are critical.
Abbvie,1ect56qjhpch5800,5,Great team!,Medical Safety Analyst,"I am a contractor, working at AbbVie. Although there is a slight divide between employees and contractors, it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough to make a difference to me personally. The team atmosphere is supportive and enthusiastic. Training is available at every turn and continued learning is a huge priority here. All in all, a fabulous company, with fabulous employees."
Abbvie,1eblovbk0rbu4801,3,not one raise in salary for the 5 years I was there.,Technical Support,You could find yourself on contract and no raise in salary for well over 10 years.The more benefits you require the smaller your salary gets. \r   Other than that a nice place to work.
Abbvie,1ebfim3qcqh39800,4,Abbvie was a very great place. I had great people to work with. All of them were helpful.,Histologist,I worked as a contractor. I worked in dern department.. I was cutting mouse skin tissue. I worked s a histologist.\r The position was cut because of budget issues due to Covid.19.
Abbvie,1ea1bd88upar9800,5,one of the best places to work if not the best,Project Coordinator,"after leaving department of defense, never thought i would find a place where i would be happy.  Abbvie was even better than that.  it was pretty amazing people, it was everyone not just a few.  Also every department i had to work with.  pay, benefits, are great.\r tough part is getting hired!"
Abbvie,1e9u833kvqm9j800,1,Poor Management,Patient Care Coordinator,Managers aren't inclusive they focus on the group of people they have known or favored the longest. GROWING UP IN THE LC area I had high Hope's for this job.  But the amount of disrespect and unprofessionalism in the work place makes for a stressful work environment.  Then they say temp to hire but rarely so they hire on. \r temp for 3+ years
Abbvie,1e9gv7vq0qg28800,4,Good environment,System Architect / Business Analyst,"I would like to continue working at AbbVie. Good environment knowledgeable co-workers, interesting projects, good location for me,\reasy access to this location."
Abbvie,1e9c5ab5rr4ut800,5,Technologically advanced,Sr. IT Project Manager,"Proper guidance, right tools and well established expectation. \rExciting but not stressful. \rPeople are supportive in most cases. \rSafe and healthy working environment."
Abbvie,1e8pn90vrhe6a800,4,Pockets of greatness,Employee Relations Specialist,"My work changed a lot in the name of being agile, but it was inconsistent and the messaging was off.  AbbVie is not clear on what they want from their employees only that they want more year in and year out.  Not sustainable for long term success.  Short stints is where people had the most success."

Abbvie,1e6f9c18nou8n800,3,I worked as a contractor so the benefits did not apply to me.,HR Contractor,A lot of the diversity talk was simply that.  I worked with some great people on really great projects but overall AbbVie is still a conservative company.  Hiring managers seem to value homogenous environments.

Abbvie,1e43qu4koo25v803,4,Nice environment,Technician/Chemist II,"Hours are flexible and workload can vary day to day. They teach you really good fundamentals, especially with GMP training.The best advice I could give is to diversify your skills and try not to let managers put you into a position that is too specialized which can hurt if you want to move out of the group into a more permanent position"

Abbvie,1e2ghot24ocet803,3,"Great place if you have long history or are a ""chosen one""",Business Technology Solutions,"AbbVie is trying to be a fast paced company but hobbles itself by being afraid to move old blood out and bring new blood in.  They will sooner lay off a 5 year high performer because it is cheaper and less risky, than someone who has been around 25 years.  This leads to some really strange management decisions that are culture killers.  The hiring cycle is so slow they must lose a ton of applicants who land elsewhere, and are also slow to recognize good talent when they have it unless it comes in through traditional sources like the graduate development program.  Having said that, for the most part I have been happy, working hard and keeping my head down while being paid well."
Abbvie,1e2bour6ohae2802,5,Employee Focused,"Sr. Manager, Head of Contact Center Operations, PMO, & BCP",AbbVie strongly cares about their employees and meeting their needs. They are inclusive and expect management to consider both employee and customer engagement and satisfaction.
Abbvie,1e24j29rehcsv801,4,One of the best in Pharma,Global Creative Project Manager,"AbbVie is a pharma juggernaut. Great people, great products and great mission. That said while it can afford to pay Pharma salaries it does suffer from an organizational bloat of countless departments, divisions, teams and acronyms-- that make for a less than streamlined workflow. Even the simplest of tasks require cross-functional input. if you're a corporate animal, you'll love it here. If you're a self-starter who needs to keep moving, do just that... keep moving, you may become restless. If you have a  passion for Pharma, look no further."

Although I was only a summer intern, I felt as though my work mattered, and that I was valued by my peers and managers. I got the opportunity to shadow anyone who's job interested me (or that I wanted to learn more about). I was also welcomed back with open arms summer after summer. I can definitely see AbbVie in my future after college."

Management is well trained to help with everything. Good benefits and salary. The bad for me was the schedule were it was rotating 24/7.
Abbvie,1e1p29oi6o90t803,2,Your experience at AbbVie could be positive if you work in the right group,Scientist II,"Pros: AbbVie is centrally located in Massachusetts away from major traffic congestion. They hire a very diverse workforce and have many employees with decades of experience. The salaries are consistent with those offered in Cambridge without the hassle of a commute. The science is very good, getting needed drugs to patients.\rNeutral: AbbVie offers garden variety benefits like health, dental, vision and life insurance as well as FSA. The 401K is typical, but has a two-year vesting period. There is an on-site gym if you have time to use it. What sets AbbVie apart from other companies is a generous pension, which also has a vesting period. EAP is excellent.\rCons: Work-life balance was non-existent in the group I worked. All timelines were considered urgent and the stress in the group was palpable. If you see a job posting using catch phrases like ""hardworking"" and ""dynamic"" expect to spend your weekends and holidays working. This is evident in only some groups, so do a little internal investigation before accepting a job there. As is typical with HR, the HR business partners work in the interest of the company with little concern for the employee. Science meetings are often competitive with a lot of posturing.\rTake home message: If you find the right group and manager, AbbVie could well be a positive experience for you. Make sure you know what environment you will be committing to, something I failed to do."

Unfortunately, due to re-orgs, I have NO manager and it's hard to grow and develop.\rI feel I own my hours as long as I get the work done.\rEveryone around me is professional, classy, health-conscious and hard working. Pays well. Benefits for employees are good (not contractors). Food good. Fitness Center convenient.\rMain gripes: Tight hierarchy. Moving up is very structured and/or network favored. Trying hard to be agile, but so many complex layers make it difficult. Can frustrate younger folk.\rOverall, I've worked at many companies and this is still a good place to work."
Abbvie,1e0tf80dhhajd803,1,Not a friendly work environment,Meeting Planner,"Poor management and very little teamwork.

Employee voice is not heard unless supports the manager of the line of business. Annual reviews are not for mutual benefits of employee and company but only for the company. Employee career path is not a priority for the company

Astoundingly abysmal leadership, hired based on nepotism rather than qualifications, experience, knowledge, education, or actual leadership abilities.  Nobody is even really sure what it is they do all day outside of counting how many minutes the employees take to go to the bathroom and running productivity reports. They have no ability to answer questions about the actual work or HR related issues. Zero work life balance, years on end of mandatory OT which would be unnecessary if leadership applied logic and reason to processes, focused on fixing the terrible systems, or implemented things that are proven to increase productivity (eg working from home, ending OT by properly staffing and training) instead of micro managing like the power tripping control freaks they are. And the work systems and platforms - absolute joke. Employees are treated like factory machines (and have actually been referred to as such by leadership in analogies), nothing is ever good enough, and all the focus is constantly on what employees are doing wrong, going so far as to blame them for the years on end of mandatory OT (as if everyone is slacking off, which most are not).  Forget making good suggestions or giving feedback on ways to improve processes, or anything else for that matter, as it WILL be reflected negatively in your reviews and in whether or not"

Abbvie has a lot of temps/contractors and when there's an opening for a position they hire the contractor but not a current employee. Which is fine, but gives no opportunity to current employees wanting to advance their careers.\r  Don't work in Pharmacy Solutions, if you want this to be an open path to something else, save yourself time. They will keep you there because they can't keep up with the volume of calls in their call center, specifically the patient assistance program. I was stuck, and decided to leave the company and found something better. \r  Pros: Benefits, Vacation time, healthcare, 401k, employee discounts.\r  Cons: No advancement, no work life balance, mandatory overtime every week, they keep you glued to your seat, question bathroom break and how long you're in the bathroom for."

Learning new ways to implement my skills and knowledge while gaining more. Management assigning work and trusting my ability enough to get it done without hovering. Having coworkers who understand my work ethic and are just nice in general. Caring enough to congratulate each other when we have life changes.

Abbvie,1d3nide2kakgk800,1,Run away from pharmacy solutions,Pharmacy Technician,"Hard to get into AbbVie and once in then hard to move up. People stay in the same position for years despite having qualifications or degrees. There is something fundamentally wrong in pharmacy solutions. In my group after five years, after dozens of people, only three people ever got promoted to other departments. Development is a complete sham. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I left when I could because I gave up trying to make an effort or impression simply making managers look good who were clueless... employees often step in to answer manager questions or help with other simple tasks.  Manager turnover rather high too. Only one manager knows what their doing. The culture isn\xe2\x80\x99t good mainly because many in techs or csr roles are never given chance to move up or shadow others. Contractors are even discriminated against if trying to apply for another Internal contractor roles. Someone needs to blow the whistle on hiring practices here. Definite EEO violations. They always decide who they want when there is a position open because they groom certain people so no one is given a fair chance. It\xe2\x80\x99s a facade to make it look like interview quota is good and just. When they decide who they want, they quickly filter people and give you fake feedback or set your interview up so you fail. Asking how many projects you have done or so and so unrealistic questions because they should know limitations in your role especially if tied to a desk or phone. Shame on AbbVie for letting such practices run rampant. There are so many talented and educated people in pharmacy solutions who are stuck because of poor culture"

Only problem was that the Management at AbbVie came from Abbott.  Only certain favorites were able to work from home at a moments notice, while others had to beg to go to a dentist appointment because your from tooth fell out.  We had several people who were doing more than 1 job and it was expected of them.  as a matter of fact we had 1 person in particular who was actually doing 3 jobs at once.  There was a lot of ""throwing people under the bus"" when management did something wrong."

My customers were very pleased with how I created and distributed their meals. I had a great rapport with my supervisor, customers and co-workers. A typical day at Abbvie was setting up the area in which I worked and being prepared for the breakfast and lunch rush hours. I learned many different ways of making salads. I also learned about many different types of cheese, as well as lunch meats and how to create many different sub sandwiches. The workplace culture was diverse. I worked with multiple nationalities, allowing me to learn traditions and languages of others. I think the hardest part of my job was being able to take and complete so many orders in a efficient time because I ad to take and make orders by myself."

There are a LOT of corporate politics at this company.  The C Suite boasts a plethora of disappointing individuals who have no interest in making AbbVie a great place to work.  It\'s fear-based.

Working at Abbvie can be great if you have a Team, and/or Manager that supports your growth, or if you have worked with individual before at Abbott, otherwise you can get stuck in the same role, same responsibilities and no room for growth. You get stuck in a role with a non-creative Manager, that is only concern about self. Therefore, when it's time for changes that could affect your role and staying with the company, you are hung out to dry. Abbvie should pay attention to all workers to make sure all are being treated fairly. I really don't think Abbvie is completely aware of all the mistreatment that is done, especially to the Admins."

Abbvie,1crqdepr3b83i800,4,Best place to learn your skills,Analytical Chemist,"Culture is not the greatest, and the managers are mostly untruthful.  My manager did not help me advance to my fullest potential, and he was a micro- manager.  Some people do not stay long, because of the culture.  Typically people leave within 2 years or less.  The hardest part of the job is there is no Career Life balance.  I have averaged a 60 hour work week.  My coworkers were awesome along with the cross functional teams.  The job itself is very interesting.  A typical day is that your manager will give you a list of things to do, and you complete the job.  You will either develop analytical methods or support the chemical pilot plant, which can create extra hours.  The plant will run 24/7 especially on weekends.  AbbVie has not created shifts for chemists so there are times I have worked 15 to 17 hours a day during pilot plant.  It is something they need to improve on."

It is also the kind of company that generally expects employees to check email on weekends and vacations.   AbbVie is a very large organization so there are plenty of career opportunities - higher up in the organization you have to be willing to move if you really want to get to the VP level in some areas."
Abbvie,1c5bpqprcaki5evl,4,Collaborative place to work with great culture of caring for each other's work.,Project Engineer/Project Manager,Working at the ABC site in Worcester was a wonderful experience.

Abbvie,1c59d2j8saqi6dp3,5,Productive Fun place to work but slow to no advancement,BTS infrastructure Architect,"AbbVie is a great company to work for as, I'm currently an full time employee. It has great benefits, good life balance and good culture but has no to impossible room for growth. You will stay at the level you came in for years unless you completely change your roles. Management is poor and have issues with other management team. Its hard for people to hold them accountable and train them for transition. Learned a lot and allowed my skills to grow, even when you give 200% you just wont get promoted."

Abbvie,1c4nb7hp052tob7j,3,Pharmacy Solultions Employee,Pharmacy Technician,"Decent company with decent benefits and if you are lucky, a pension and 401k.  This is a very fast paced company with lots to offer in the realm of job diversity.  You can move and grow within the company.  Unfortunately many of the managers come in using this company as a stepping stone.  They come with education and no people skills.  They seek to make a name for themselves by saving money with no consideration of the impact their decisions have on employees.  This is based on a lack of experience. \rMany try to change the world without consideration or regard for what has been done or tried in the past.  Some management  is just plagued with egotistical and narcissistic traits that they just drive potentially positive and productive employees out the door, due to fear of being challenged.  If the management values and vision would change to one of not only profits, margins and their own success, this could be a much better place to work.  \rFrom a company standpoint overall, I do recommend it but keep away from some areas unless you enjoy the childhood/grammar school behavior.  If you get there and see it, run.  There are many more companies out there with better cultures."

They also had inadequate reporting tools that showed you were not doing your work when in fact you could prove with emails that it was done. This ended up going on many people's reviews with negative impacts, and was quite the surprise as we all were doing our jobs. Management refused to remove that information. I was also put on a performance plan and left to manage the phones, voicemails, emails, and escalations with one other person while our whole team was in training for weeks. Then management blamed us for not being able to handle the work of a team of 19. I was terminated for that."

The culture of the environment does not lack the tension of micromanagement but with some managers micromanagement isnt there at all.

Til management changes and they change everythingrything not knowing anything about what the job is and just sit back til it is time to leave for another role and then the next airhead comes in and does the same thing all over again. Management seems to change every year and it is always young college interns who become management.. Job advancements use to happen often but now with all the changes happening it is very hard to near impossible unless you do some major butt kissing and licking it seems.

Downside is they still base career advancement based on scientific expertise/knowledge.  A brilliant scientist with advanced degrees and numerous publications does not translate to a good manager of people.  Too many brilliant scientists with high level management positions that lack good people management skills

Abbvie,1ai0jj9ie1d020ao,3,No Comment,Document Clerk I,No comment - nothing to say about company - best way to find out is to apply and work for them yourselves. Form your own opinions.
Abbvie,1ahbvnimd52uqb5t,2,Nice place for a brief pit stop,Clinical Study Associate,"Abbvie uses its location heavily to its advantage as there are no other large pharma companies based in the area. They use this to leverage low pay and posses the mentality they do not care if you stay or leave. Upward movement within the company is stagnant and many directors and managers are hired from external sources. Extremely high turn over and require you to be a contract employee with no benefits, sick days , or paid time off for a year prior to being hired. Great for a brief pit stop then move on to an actual career with upward opportunities. Terrible at talent retention. Focus more on incoming college students than employees that already work there."

Abbvie,1ae54pufuas1u84u,1,Micro Management,Multiple roles,This is a worst place to work. \rThe only thing the management do is micro management which makes day to day work very slow.

I do see my supervisor on a weekly basis to go over stats, productivity and things of that nature.  My co workers are lively some are just there for a job, others want to advance into other departments and then you have the ones who try and work hard because they feel they have something to prove. The hardest part of the job to me there isn't really one for me.  I mean when you have been in customer service you learn that you are going to deal with all kinds of people.

Gastroenterology would use pancreatic enzymes for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to chronic pancreatitis and pulmonology dieticians would use them for the complications of CF. In endocrinology, internal medicine, and oncology, pancreatic enzymes were used for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency with variable causes, a diagnosis which required a lot of physician education. \rMy work in CF was both the hardest part and the most rewarding part of my position.I would see first hand the challenges of the disease, malnourished patients barely able to eat and breathe seeking any help available.

During the first 3 months the company sent me over-seas to the Netherlands to train there for 10 weeks for an intense training course.  Management was great and I loved my Regional Manager.  My co-workers were excellent as well and we worked well as a team.  The hardest part of the job was the insecurity.  The were so many rumors about GE Electric buying us out and of lay-offs that is one of the main reasons why I pursued other opportunities.

Once learning the method of the task, getting the job done is easy. Management is split into 3 ways. We have 3 teams doing different projects that all ties up into one. Everyone is nice. I've learned a lot about pharmaceutical jobs and the way companies work through this job. I'd have to say the hardest thing about this job is really just making sure you keep your error rate below a certain percentage.

Accenture,1fk5no4q7u3lr800,4,Many opportunities to grow,Senior Manager,Accenture is so large that you have room to grow no matter your talent and skillset. On the flip side its so large that there a communities and networks you have to build in order to grow inside the organization
Accenture,1fk348811u3mm800,2,just meh all around,Associate Manager,"I have gotten a lot of experience at this company, but they are not interested in recognizing employees for their work. The company is currently bleeding employees and replacing them with US-based contractors or hiring FTE in low-cost countries so that they can save a few bucks rather than investing in and promoting the talented employees that they have. This is a good place to get some experience and then GET OUT."
Accenture,1fk32rdc6t4cg800,4,Productive workplace ,ID Theft Consultant,"Great contract job, there is room for growth, but it is a struggle not being pulled from a good project once you\xe2\x80\x99ve accepted a permanent position. Can be a hit or miss. "

They CLAIM that is the case, The WORST IT Network in the World. ZERO IT Support for critical breakdowns. New Management does NOT Understand the Roles of employees and does NOT Talk to them.  Management does NOT know effective Processes that employees are using and is completely Clueless. The Peers are the BEST!  They are the lifeblood and reason for any shred of company success.  "
Accenture,1fjlvnh00u1am801,2,Great promise and culture! Needs work to live up to the dream.,Senior Cyber Security Analyst,The culture and attitude of Accenture are amazing. They help support your progress and development. They need to work on the complexity and downright chaos of their site and resources. They also lack the integration and capability to fully utilize their talent pool. The skill matching system has great potential but is not quite there yet. Some of the benefits are good however the healthcare insurance options for US employees are very bad. They are not remotely competitive. Some projects are chaotic and have poor onboarding without much support. The focus on education is good however the implementation is poor. The courses are too generic and there are not enough of them to cover the skills necessary to maintain an innovative edge.
Accenture,1fjkl3eu6t4b9800,3,Great place to work if you are a sheep,Software Engineer II,"You MUST support the company's agendas, both professional, political, and it's easier if you are an atheist.

Accenture,1fjgj5379u1t1800,4,Opportunities for growth but often challenging work life balance,Team Lead,"Accenture is a great company with opportunities for growth, but work life balance has become an issue. Too much work and not enough resources in order achieve day to day work and stretch goals. "
Accenture,1fjee7a5mt4l8800,4,Overall a good company to work at,Procurement Manager,"The strongest area of the company is flexibility and overall work-life balance (if you know how to set boundaries). Salaries are not the best, but flexibility makes up for it. In general it is very complicated to have a mental image of the companies endless number of teams and processes, in which you loose a lot of time."
Accenture,1fj8c19c9oc9d800,1,Terrible culture,Senior Manager Digital Sales and Consulting,"The Managing Director\xe2\x80\x99s are condescending and rude. They will not answer any email from junior people unless it is an issue concerning a specific project. They routinely add themselves to projects if they have no work, even if it means that existing staff lose their jobs. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a project to work on then you are at risk of losing your job. This is a unique culture where no one cares, there is no hands on management help and if you need a subject matter expert your attempts to get help will be ignored. The level of expertise is exaggerated to win business. All the hard work is done overseas. Self importance rules. Not a good place to thrive"

Accenture,1fiplm5jvt4lq800,2,Tribalism and Lack of Support,Salesforce Business Analyst (Contract),"The team I worked on was passive-aggressive and not a great team to work with. There were times that emails I sent would go unread, and those same people who missed you would try and throw you under the bus for lack of communication.The managers do not care about the concerns that their teams have and often only have anything to say when things go wrong."
Accenture,1fiod8aj0nph6800,5,Great Company,Sr. Analyst,Friendly environment & very good growth for freshers .Salary compensation can be increased bit more atleast to those who stay here for long.Also employees shall be encouraged to switch projects every 2 years so that one can unskill & have better exposure.

Accenture,1fikrfgf1u48j801,2,Not much career growth ,QA Tester,"I\'ve worked with Accenture since 2016. I\'ve had a few different roles and have worked with several clients. I\'ve done medical claim processing and software testing - UAT and QA testing.In the medical claim processing area it\'s typically a pretty easy and stress free job. However, there is no room to move up and grow. The managers I\'ve had were not very helpful and did not care to see their people grow. Also, the micro management is at an extreme. Every second is tracked. In the software testing area, the main issues I\'ve had are: lack of training and horrible onboarding experiences. These projects tend to be more flexible with schedules and tend not to micro manage. Work/life balance is pretty good.You\'re experience at Accenture really depends on what you\'re hired for, what project you\'re working on, what client you\'re working with. Some projects are better than others. Also, watch out for positions labeled as ""Accenture Flex"". You will be paying triple the amount for insurance, you have less PTO, you don\'t get holidays off, you\'re less likely to get bonuses and raises. It\'s very had to get out of Flex, even when you try to transition to a non flex position... they will do their best to make you stay flex or make it impossible to transfer over."
Accenture,1fik4o0n5r88t800,2,good salary but too much politics and backstabbing,Manager,"Good salary, but terrible corporate culture. The Direction is directionless. Being a yes-man will move your career ahead. Lots of political games and backstabbing. The company is notorious for jumping on bandwagon of whatever is deemed to be in-fashion. Consequently, if you have an opinion that differs from the echo-chamber, better stay quiet or else everyone will isolate you and try to get you to leave the company."
Accenture,1fiiveiomu270800,1,Do Not Go to Texas Medicaid,Prefer not to say,This project is horrible and disorganized. The management is terrible.

Accenture,1fiilneqvu2bk800,3,Stressful and bad leadership,Analyst,Average workday is 9-13 hours and leadership is poor. I have yet to meet a good project lead that I can learn from. Toxic teams and lots of uninteresting work and lack of transparency across the board. 
Accenture,1fid5lromo1fe801,4,Comfortable workplace,Developer Appeals Analyst,"This job will make you comfortable so you wouldn't want to leave.The work/life balance is great, work stays at work. When you are off work, you don't have to worry about your job until the next day. The pay is somewhat generous for what you do at work. Your hours are very flexible and lenient. There are some micromanagement however."
Accenture,1fi8jsh49n52s802,4,Good work life balance,Sr. Reporting and Data Analyst,Accenture has made great progress overall as a company and that comes from great leadership skills and providing excellent customer relationship. I have worked on various projects for Accenture around Austin and the project you pick will largely determine whether you get growth/technological advancements or whether you get stuck and become stagnant.  Some projects do offer great compensations and some are very restricted on budget and might not offer any great benefits.

Accenture,1fhtlndvsu36a801,3,Frat boy  mentality,Consultant,One too many former front boys in charge. No diversity. You can move up in the company if you play the game of being the right type of employee. Many times assignments are based on favoritism.

Accenture,1fhr8t5l7u31n801,3,Ok place to work,Software Engineer Associate,They hire you to do something but you end up doing something else instead. Disorganized. High expectations with no clear goal. Will blame you for their lack of communication. 
Accenture,1fhmj29fvt49t800,3,"Great place to work for IT consulting, less so for strategy",Consultant,"Tech is the firm's bread and butter - it's what Accenture is known for and if you have a tech background, it's a great place to apply your knowledge to consulting. For pure play strategy , there is a wide definition of what exactly that entails and they are still trying to figure out how to stand out in that field. The inconsistency of training and support would make me hesitate from a strategy perspective."
Accenture,1fhc9tpdku2l5802,4,Great place to work,Marketing Manager,"Fully remote depending on the team, plenty of room for advancement or to another team, competitive pay/benefits, but your manager can make or break your job."

Plus their leadership is terrible, they treat people like trash. then throw them out whenever they can replace them offshore or with importing people. It's shocking their stock has done so well....they still run interenally like the did back in the days of Enron. I don't even think they can spell SOX in finance where most of their finance people are in Buenos Aries, have no finance background and barely speak English. "
Accenture,1fgt5eq60s9uh801,1,Good place to gain experience as a junior programmer...,Application Development Analyst,...however I was hired as a mid-level/senior and I find it is tricky to advance in your career in Accenture as such. Work/life balance and stress levels vary depending on the project and I have had bad luck with projects. Job security is guaranteed however working hard and smart while being a team player won't get you a promotion. Learning new things is also dependent on the project. I wouldn't recommend to anyone to start working in Accenture as a programmer.
Accenture,1fgk8ealln5d5801,5,Great work from home job,Claim Processing Specialist,Love it! they are so helpful and the pay is good. I liked working from home so that was a plus and a lot of opportunities for growth which is always great.

They provide a lot of training and certification help and challenge you to improve your skills. They encourage you to learn and grow and as long as you do honest work and represent the company well at client sites, you'll get a decent raise and bonus at the end of the year.Once you start getting into management and want to move up higher, it seems you have to do more than just doing well at the client site. You have to do more in terms of improving the company internally like hosting learning session, writing blogs, participating in side projects (which are actually really cool), etc. This could be a drawback or a benefit depending on what you like, but it could result in working more than a standard 40 hour work week.

The job security is nice, in my experience it takes a lot to get someone fired, however, you are unlikely to advance in your career within this company. Your experience will be entirely dependent on your management. I have experienced some of the best and some of the worst managers while at Accenture so it can be a toss up. Most people get hired with a referral, and the management can play favorites a lot."

Learning iterative methodologies is great, and it helps to be among those practicing them!On the bad side - it is very siloed. You will be in a region typically and if you are not working in that region they will try to pull you back. Even if that means leaving a role you like for one that is not a good fit."

Accenture,1fachs9q6t47d802,5,Diverse workforce and a lot of opportunities ,Consultant,I had a solid 3 year tenure at Accenture Federal Services. They have a lot of contracts with many roles. The biggest downside is the below market pay as an entry-level analyst. 
Accenture,1face8ppnu31c800,4,found me a project quickly ,State of Maryland Unemployment Claims Processor,Had a team lead that definitely cared for all of us.

Accenture,1fa6ctfpjs7ln800,3,There's good... but work yourself to death to find it,Strategy Analyst,"I work within accenture strategy and I do not at all recommend it. You have to network to get staffed on projects and you are evaluated based on the percent of time that you are on staffable work, but it's hard to get staffed on things that you care about. Leadership doesn't care about people either"

Accenture,1f9s3iqrrs7ln800,4,There are pockets of great people within the company,Business Strategy Manager,"While there are great people in some areas within Accenture, it is not always easy to find them... You will be given opportunities for advancement so long as you play the game well, but sometimes the hoops and hurdles feel a little silly, especially at the junior levels. This improves somewhat as you move up, and the focus shifts more to political and social connections. The pay is solid, but could be better, typically Accenture is slow to raise pay (relative to market) and quick to cut when times are tough. "
Accenture,1f9pm129lnpjo802,4,Good,Sse,Good company to work for. Best service based company in the industry. Most employee friendly company. Feel free to join it.Best company to work in. Please join and be happy.
Accenture,1f9ljq5bonpjo802,4,If you like constant change and uncertainty this is the place for you,Consulting Analyst,There's lots of changes while working at Accenture. You will most likely be on a different client project every 3 months. If you like constant change this is the place for you. There are endless trainings and documents for you to upskill and learn. There is no hand holding and your career depends all on you. This can be good for some people and absolutely tragic for others.
Accenture,1f9l3qnges7ln800,5,Best job ever,Transaction Processing Specialist,"I actually enjoy my job so much. So much overtime available. Management is wonderful, great communication & dedication.

Accenture,1f9kmmjumnpkq800,1,Kaos is what I experienced at Accenture ,Alliance Sales Director,"What you think you are getting into is not what the job is. To compare it to retail, it is called bait and switch. I did not learn anything at Accenture. Culture was cold. Hardest part of the job was trying to get someone to help you. I did not enjoy the job at all. "
Accenture,1f9hjnpe4s7ln800,5,Great Company ,Unemployment Claims Specialist,The team I worked with was absolutely amazing. The contract was extended and additional month.

Accenture,1f99b07v6ocrl801,1,Really bad experience,Customer Service Representative,"Low salaries. really bad management and overall bad experience, this job is for someone who can get kicked and pushed all the time, please think twice before applying for this job."
Accenture,1f97tcmatu2h4801,5,Great place to start,Information Technology Analyst,"A great place to start your career and build connections, but the work load and hours can be overwhelming. That said, it will look good on your resume and help you land a less crazy job. "
Accenture,1f94k5hhet4ig801,2,"Ability to work from home, but terrible work life balance. ",Executive Support Analyst,"Incredibly difficult for a minority to receive a promotion. The favorites seem to be the ones who get promoted. While I was with Accenture, I saw far too many quality employees leave the company. They changed their business model in 2018 unfortunately no one knows or understands what that new model is. It was called \xe2\x80\x9cTruly Human\xe2\x80\x9d but very few of their employees went through the training and therefore don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it. "
Accenture,1f8t3q593u2hf800,1,Take ANY job besides this one,Customer Service Representative,"This job was a scam. They \xe2\x80\x9ctrain\xe2\x80\x9d you  for 2 weeks, but give you no real info or knowledge that you will actually use on a day to day basis. Management is absolutely ridiculous. Call avoidance is the only thing they know how to do, and blame it on \xe2\x80\x9chaving the same access\xe2\x80\x9d as CSR\xe2\x80\x99s. Their systems work terrible, but then blame you for being in system issues for several minutes at a time. Take any other job besides this one. No PTO, no paid holidays, schedules aren\xe2\x80\x99t great, and the pay isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth getting treated terribly. Spare your mental health/happiness. "

Accenture,1f8rk4r25o2j3800,4,Great place to start a career ,Senior Manager,"The pros: Interesting work much of the time, smart people, clear progression pathThe cons: Some projects will not align with your interests and you just have to suck it up and deliver. Wages are below par compared to industry until you reach very senior levels. Work life balance is a challenge as it is in many consulting services. "
Accenture,1f8om01v8t63g800,5,Great place to advance your skills and learn networking,Application Development Analyst,Great place to work if you value innovation and continued learning. Lots to learn and the company almost expects you to get certifications depending on where you aligned to.
Accenture,1f8gr581rs7ng800,4,Overall good place to work for.,Application Development Associate Manager,Fulfilling if you take charge of your roles.Individual offices may be limited in roles offered.Willingness to travel opens up more opportunities.Networking makes getting new roles easier.
Accenture,1f8fl2anms7nm800,4,Good to work & learn,SAP Lead Consultant,Accenture is very aggresive into working. I have leant a lot during my tenure in Accenture. Accenture has lot of projects and all can fit into the role and work of the projects.
Accenture,1f8alcvsqs7nm800,5,It was remote,Call Center Customer Service Representative,"Coworkers were very helpful with each other  and team leads had no problem teaching if you weren't clear on something. It was remote  and the pay was great, considering the duties. "
Accenture,1f8ai86rro27c800,5,"Accenture truly cares about the well being of their employees. They are fair, honest and work with you. ",Content Moderator,I was extremely impressed with the level of trust they give their employees. Leadership was available when needed but there was no micromanaging. As long as you communicate they work with you to ensure you have a great work life balance. The project I was on was a bit emotionally draining but I felt supported every single day. There was plenty of opportunity for advancement. 
Accenture,1f86pn22co28m800,5,Productive and Team leads are very helpful,Customer Service Agent,I work remotely from home on eastern time and I still enjoy my job having a passion to help others with empathy and active listening and having patience. I love my job
Accenture,1f7ukonh6o1cg800,1,"If you want to be paid decently but treated horribly, then this is the place for you!",Customer Service Representative,"Good: The pay, good benefits, don't work weekends. Bad: lack of communication, favoritism, horrible management. This company is horrible. You will only move forward if you're close friends to management. They say that mental and physical health is important but if you miss one day because you are really ill, you get disciplined. Management doesn't care if others do their jobs right, doesn't communicate anything to their employees, and they don't care about their employees. If you want to be paid decently but treated horribly, then this is the place for you!"
Accenture,1f7uemi9ssa97800,4,The people make Accenture worthwhile. ,Sourcing Specialist,"I\'ve been with Accenture for a few years now and have seen change for better and for worse.  Benefits are better than average (but that\'s not surprising for a large corporation) including an adoption stipend and fertility coverage under the medical plans in the US. Within my group, WLB is hit or miss depending upon you project alignment to the point where I\'ve worked 80+ hours or 30 hours in a week. Travel is minimal for my role, maybe 1-2 times annually. The best part is the people, though. Corny, I know, but true. I\'ve made true friends here and have learned more than I thought I could from some incredible professionals. On that note, the bad...Compensation is lacking and there\'s zero transparency on salary ranges by level. I came in to the company on a lowball offer (silly me) and haven\'t yet achieved the wages of some of my peers despite positive annual reviews and consistent plus ones. Worse, there is still blatant gender wage disparity despite senior management\'s touting equality. Promotions only happen if the business has a need for your level and role which is disheartening to those of us who are consistent high performers but not sitting with the ""right"" group. Overall, I continue to stay with the company because I love my colleagues, but I\'m not a lifer. "
Accenture,1f7ma50acn59q800,3,They’re all Liars ,CFO Advisor for Accenture,"It\xe2\x80\x99s a great company to work for, but everyone is ready to stab you in the back at a moments notice, and then the whole thing feels like a mirage. The people are lovely and you\xe2\x80\x99ll like them, but it\xe2\x80\x99s all a front. And their real business is outsourcing the jobs of America, a tune to 20B$ a year. Check your soul at the door "
Accenture,1f7k3d0bvhirt800,1,Poor management,Consultant,"Depends on what project you are put on on, but the one I was on had high turnover with management that was incompetent and detached.  It's difficult to change projects and management actually makes it difficult for you to leave the project.Had I been placed on another project, my experience may have been completely different, but unfortunately you are assigned to a project after you are hired instead of during the interview process, so you really don't have any idea what the job will be like. "
Accenture,1f7jdlcvcu26j800,4,Working from home made it even better.,Recruiting Specialist,"They will let you self train and at a self pace, ONLY when they have no work to do. Most of the work I had to learn was about Artificial Intelligence, Block chain, Data, Security, Dev Ops, Agile Solutions, all of which had no bearing on my role as a Recruiter."
Accenture,1f6t96b81s9vq800,2,Glorified & Expensive Body Shopping Company,Data Engineering Manager,Accenture charges about 2-3 times more than a typical tech consulting company. It leads to high expectations from the Client. We are always under the gun.
Accenture,1f6saepmu3obs000,4,"Good overall, but low pay for developers",Technology Application Development Analyst,"The company is good, supportive, and inclusive.  I would say that pay is lower than other companies for Developers and the promotion system needs some improvement, but that is something that they seem to be changing over time."
Accenture,1f6r55q5thijp800,4,Good learning experience ,Consultant,"Good for new graduates, chances to try many different projectsWork life balance is difficult to achieve. Your career growth depends heavily on the projects and connections you made"

Accenture,1f6e3noktu3a7800,4,Long hours and little pay and recognition is zilch,Recruiting Senior Analyst,Work till 12a or longer with little to no recognition of extra hours or hard work to meet deadline.  I often did the work of 3 people but when deadlines were missed it was our fault. 
Accenture,1f6e1cjuo3ocs000,1,"Stressful, miscommunication, no opportunity to grow, really bad management ",Content Review Analyst,"I\xe2\x80\x99m the begging you would feel great and happy working there but in time you realize it is very stressful environment not because of the work itself, it\xe2\x80\x99s because the management they make it very stressful place to be successful."

Accenture,1f5lt0kl1o1kn800,2,Project work can vary,Program Manager,"I enjoyed working for my client, but oftentimes, you feel more drawn to the work your client is doing than the work your company (in this case, Accenture) is doing.   It is what it is, but as a consultant, if you get emotionally invested in the work for your client, you will feel a sense of not belonging to either your current company nor your client.....both feel like you're being kept at arms distance.My current project has people regularly working 10-15 hour days and weekends with no reprieve, despite alerting management to feelings of burnout.  Management talks the talk, but doesn't walk the walk when it comes to helping people manage their workload."
Accenture,1f5itf44iu3af800,3,Good company to work for,Supplier Quality Engineer,It is a good company to work for. The work life balance is really great. But compensation is on the lower end for requiring an engineering degree. Not many positions to advance your career.

It brings out the best in me and I realize that even though I am a person with disability, I can still work in corporate industry. I wish I was given a longer time working with them because I enjoyed my work with Accenture a lot. I know I have a lot to contribute specially in terms of process improvement."

Accenture,1f4t4esulu392800,3,Job security - But Higher management is pain !!,Oracle EBS Consultant,"The company is filled with lobby. If you are part of the lobby, things will go smooth & you can achieve your career goals way easily than expected. The company have a vision but hired a bunch of insane people who can make your life miserable. If you have a competing offer, don't bother to turn back !! This company will not recognize your value until you resign."
Accenture,1f4j3seda2v6h000,5,Overall Great,Content Review Analyst,"This would be the perfect company to work with, I'm just happy to be here. Maybe the cons would be the HR, management and all of the problems with human interactions with leaders, but it's all okay "

Accenture,1f4606f8ru20v800,1,Badly Run Company,Software Product Arch Manager,"Leadership cares more about being woke than running a profitable company.  Constant hectoring emails from Leadership forcing their leftist politics on employees.I for one do not care about the politics that one espouses, and I feel that a company that values diversity should understand that people do not like to have a point of view forced upon them."
Accenture,1f3tu0ergt5di800,3,Good place to work after university,Data Analyst,An okay place to work to gain experience after university but not many progression opportunities to succeed further in the company. It has a good work/life balance and some nice perks.

Accenture,1f3iborpcu3dj800,4,Great Place tonwork,Manager,"Great place to work.  Almost everyone you work with is very talented and professional. Good variety of work as well.  My biggest complaint would be that they sometimes don\xe2\x80\x99t manage your career very well.  They have me like a jack of all trades so I\xe2\x80\x99m not heavily specialized.  When I approached a senior manager about this I was told that being a generalist wasn\xe2\x80\x99t bad,  that the pendulum was always swinging between specialists and generalists "
Accenture,1f390dcd1u3bc800,3,Good company,Consultant,"People you work with are great. Diverse range of expertise and talent. However, you do have to look after yourselves and tap into the expertise and talents of the individuals you work with. Otherwise, you will not thrive. "

Accenture,1f2i4k846u1v3800,5,Great company,Manager,"I've really enjoyed by time as a management consultant at Accenture. The work is challenging and the exposure to large clients is a major plus. You do have to be mindful of steering your own career path here, however. "
Accenture,1f2hejapo3h8b000,5,Great,Content Moderator,"So far so good. they look after you, but there could be more room for improvement on the advancement and promotions. currently working from home so it's hard to communicate and be personable with the team. "

Accenture,1f24r1lihhim2800,3,"Solid place, just stay on top of your growth.",Consultant,"A lot of misinformation regarding the different career tracks and what they mean for you and your growth with the company. Good team and culture, but poor management of performance and promotions."

Accenture,1f23ua6hnnppi800,4,Productive and great work life balance,Senior Software Engineer,"Nice company to work with, totally depends on which project you get. Sometimes management will not notice you if you are only working for the client.."
Accenture,1f21ns89pu1v3800,4,"If you can imagine it, you can do it.",Commercial Director/Managing Director,Demanding environment that has big reward payoffs in career exploration and career advancement.  The company has many opportunities to engage with smaller communities with shared interest which lends itself to being a part of a shared collective community within the larger company environment.
Accenture,1f1tqeocqu3hv800,4,It All Depends,Senior Analyst,"I know that's sort of a cop out, but it's true in cases where you work for a enormous company like Accenture.  It depends on which project you're on, who you know, and who will support you in your career.  It's very niche, but if you can find the right one, then you'll be very successful.  Otherwise it's easy to be just a cog in a wheel and not feel like you're working towards anything meaningful.  I think overall it's a good place to work at just to gain experience.  Whether you stay long term or not will depend on what I mentioned before."
Accenture,1f1te8oacu3hv800,3,Great benefits but little job security,Manager,Compensation and benefits are fantastic. Work/life balance is hit or miss. You earn a healthy amount of PTO but many times can not get the time off so can potentially lose it. In management days are very long. It is also questionable how effective a manager you can be for your people when your team can number more than 50. Like most companies these days they overkill pushing political views and inclusion and diversity training.  There is a lot of opportunity to build knowledge and skills but at times the amount of \xe2\x80\x9cencouraged\xe2\x80\x9d trainings can be overwhelming to the point of affecting your ability to do the job you\xe2\x80\x99re paid to do.  Every time a client contract ends you must seek and interview for a new role. Maybe I am old school but I feel once you are hired by a company you should have a job and not have the added stress of being unemployed every few months/years. If you enjoy a lot of change or are a ladder climber you can do well. If you want to just do the best job that you can with longevity until retirement you may end up elsewhere. 
Accenture,1f1si9giqu40q800,2,Great Learning Opportunities to learn new things through their knoweldge portal,"Management Consulting Manager, Payer and Provider",Great place to learn new things through their knowledge portal.

Accenture,1f1qquq1ht4pr800,4,"Good career growth, bad work life balance",Consultant,"Accenture is a place where you can learn a lot of things, but it is also a place that will at times demand you sacrifice your life outside of work.

Accenture,1f1lssf23u3hv800,3,Meaningful work experience and learning opportunities offered at an project entry-level position,Platform Experience New Associate,"Accenture offers great learning material and tech industry grooming through online resources, but you have to seek it out for yourself. No one really minds which grunt leads the grunt work, so as long as it gets done.if you're looking for mentorship this is not the place... I can't emphasize that enough. The experience of working at any corporate entry-level position is going to be whatever you make of it at the end of the day. "

They honestly care about their employees and do all they can to ensure you have all of the proper training and equipment to succeed. Everyone is very nice and helpful. The management really strive to give you an adequate work/homelife balance. I 100% recommend working for Accenture!
Accenture,1f0m7qdban54g800,4,"Not bad to work for, consulting has pros and cons",System Developer Analyst,Consulting work has its pros and cons based on the project you're working on and the duration. Does give you opportunity to pick up new skills and to work on different projects but you do sometimes need to have strong networking to make those connections.
Accenture,1f0l8d8h3o1hv800,4,Good for less than 8 years experience people,Software Engineer,Accenture is very good up to team lead level w.r.t job security ..Hikes are very good.Culture is very good and depends on project.Clients also very good.
Accenture,1f0jim6pqs7jc800,3,DEcent,Digital Marketing Specialist,I worked at Accenture during summer as a digital marketing analyst and I must say that I hat the fact that they hire contractors. It's really just corporate America not wanting to pay proper saleirs and benefits and the government does nothing about it.
Accenture,1f0i20dh0o1hv800,4,"Great pay, not great work life balance",Strategy Consultant,"Really differs based on role and practice, but working with Accenture Strategy requires hard work. There is often lack of work life balance especially given COVID-19.. Pay is great compared to industry but maybe less so compared to MBB, LEK, etc."
Accenture,1f0hvmjphn54g800,4,Goal oriented and fast paced,Medical Claims Analyst,Training is long but thorough. There are many resources to help you after training as well. The goals and expectations are clear cut from the beginning and are relayed to the team in a timely manner.
Accenture,1f0hioj8qo1hv800,3,Position turned into straight sales revenue job,Managing Director,"Accenture is a good company with a lot of capability - if you have a large digitally driven need and need a lot of help solving it - Accenture is a top choice.  Personal experience was not as positive.  Original recruiting was more to develop new product and solutions.  Turned in to straight revenue generation role.  Some groups had relatively positive culture, some groups that were more revenue only focused had a more traditional rough sales language culture that was not attractive or motivating."

Accenture,1f0c5mi9lt4qe800,1,One of the worst companies ,Medical Claims Processor ,"I have had several jobs over the years and this has been by far the worst. They lied during my interview about pay, career advancement, etc and they will lie to you! There isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough pay in this world to get me to deal with half of the mess I dealt with. Management is clueless and has zero clue how to lead. Training was extremely fast and pushy! If you don\xe2\x80\x99t learn fast, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the job for you! My entire team didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel comfortable completing the work after training and we expressed that we needed more time, but management did not care about our concerns. Everyone would get emails stating, \xe2\x80\x9cif you can\xe2\x80\x99t be faster at processing, then we will get rid of you!\xe2\x80\x9d That is not how you treat employees! I will never recommend this company to anyone!! With this company it is QUANTITY over QUALITY!! Applicants beware!!! "
Accenture,1f09p0ppiu4d4800,3,Nice temporary company,Lead Technician,"I have worked for about 2 years, there is a lot of competition between managers to get their own people recognized so at the end it feels like several groups with a internal cold war between them"

Accenture,1evtjutqvn52h800,2,average tech company,Performance Engineer /DevOps /Automation Engineer / Team Lead,Life/ work balance is good. It is not good at performance review. I would say it is one of worst companies that I have experienced. Many layers of management do not promote to get things done effectively. You will be evaluated by the work that you have done. 
Accenture,1evqouh8326a4000,5,Slow advancement in corporate functions ,Technology Security Manager,"I work in a corporate functions role so I have great work life balance, but that means promotions are harder to come by. Lots of really talented people all competing for the same spots. "

Accenture,1ev06aq4an55l800,3,Limited opportunities in Raleigh,Consulting Analyst,"Accenture is a massive company that does a lot of great work. With 500k employees globally, Accenture\'s talent pool is very mixed with good and bad. However, opportunities in Raleigh are limited to mostly government and healthcare work. The young and naive are put into positions that few would want, and experienced hires have limited opportunities for work outside of Raleigh-Durham. I would not recommend Accenture Raleigh unless you want to work in healthcare or state government projects. ""Networking"" is largely superficial and unrealistic with remote-only work. For a relationship-based company/role, it has been very challenging to build meaningful relationships since I have never met a co-worker in person."
Accenture,1eutsieg5t5ho800,2,Communication sucks,Unemployment Claims Customer Service Representative,Communication is terrible and start date keeps changing . I have been lied to about my start day three times already. I haven't gotten a chance to even see what the job is like 
Accenture,1eutksd0f26ak000,2,Internal competition for chargeability creates silos,Industry Principal Director,"At the top of the organization, the C-suite execs preach teaming and caring, but the gulf between them and the workforce is vast. No matter what is stated about teaming and valuing opinions and expertise, at the end of the day, if you're not chargeable, you're on a short list for layoffs.They reportedly turn over 5% of their 600,000 workforce a year, and it was far worse this past year. The culture is about infusing as many consultants into a project as possible, and extending that project as long as possible. Younger workers are worked very hard with promotions dangled in front of them. Experienced hires are under intense pressure to sell huge projects with PowerPoints meant to baffle and bewilder. "
Accenture,1euls7o3uu1ib800,3,Colleagues were knowledgeable and helpful,Project Manager,"From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, don\xe2\x80\x99t come down with illness/family emergency. If you use FMLA your job will become \xe2\x80\x9credundant\xe2\x80\x9d and you will be laid off upon return. "
Accenture,1eujf50lnu1ib800,5,"Bring your A game, and you will be empowered to be a difference maker",Senior Manager,"Accenture will challenge you each and every day, there are a lot of incredibly talented people here and you will get opportunities to showcase what you can bring to the table.I'm fortunate to be under a tremendous group and management team who values my opinions and really do everything they can to get me exposure in front of clients, industry, and senior management teams at the company.No, the job is not easy and there will be some long days, but is it rewarding? Heck yes."
Accenture,1eufj3tjr3h8h000,3,Good and Bad so it equates to average ,Analyst,"Over all the job is OK. They pay for a flex position isn't great, promotions are none existent, but its secure and you'll always have a job if you do above the bare minimum. "
Accenture,1euedt0pku1ib800,1,Downhill ,Consultant,Worked here 8 years on 3 contracts. First one was good except we never got raises but work was fulfilling. Last two contracts/2 years were all about busy work with no direction or support. The entire company culture now reflects this way of life. Revolving door of entry level and basically a cutthroat game of stealing or swapping workforce back and forth between competitors. Pay is ok and benefits good. 
Accenture,1eu1c06tun5b4800,3,Depends on what you do....,Senior Risk and Payment Analyst,"This company has spectacular opportunities, but should really focus on the clients they have to support their current workers. There shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a reason there are contract workers with roles that should be FTE positions at major companies, specifically the Big 4 tech companies. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great job out of college, with pay that needs to be way better if folks are to support tech hubs in growing cities. Cost of living does not match to the support that\xe2\x80\x99s being asked of contract workers. "
Accenture,1etoh85t5u312800,4,Good place to work,Content Review Analyst,"The work is not very difficult. They give you lots of training and if you need more, they wont decline. I felt that I had the support when I needed it. "

Accenture,1etd1ddlru1n1800,1,Does not care about you,Subject Matter Expert,"Runaway, you can do better anywhere else. There is no respect for your mental health or your time.

Accenture,1et9psc54u1n1800,3,Always on edge. You never know where you stand,Cloud Services Operations Associate Manage,At accenture they have great people but you are always on edge.

Accenture,1esua9084u1n1800,4,Satisfaction depends on project,System Developer Analyst,"Some projects better than others, along with managers.

Accenture,1est4ifnusa2t800,3,Generally supportive when it comes to everyday job functions,Sr. Analyst - GFEBS (SAP) Deployment,Good: Local management is very hands-off.Bad: C-level suite has extremely pre-conceived political opinions that are communicated quite frequently. I simply think politics should be left out of corporate life. 
Accenture,1esrfcoeuu3cn800,5,The firm,"Snr Manager Organization Development, Talent and Change Management","There is a great deal of pride amongst employees to be part of this huge innovative organization of over 300 000+ employees.The motto here is work hard and play hard. In non Covid times, in spite of long days with six meetings or more a day and time to complete deliverables, teams get together 2-3 times a week after work, as result teams become extremely cohesive.Brilliant colleagues and culture of excellence make Accenture a great, but challenging place to work, as one needs to constantly up one's game to keep up.Life balance is still elusive, in spite of the company's best attempts"
Accenture,1esr1pleuu3cn800,2,Just another number,Claims Processor,"3 month training followed by 2 weeks of on job training (or practice) from what was reviewed over the past 3 months. And then they start pushing to meet goals. 3 months worth of information takes longer than 2 weeks to become comfortable using. All they seem to care about is ""production"". Getting that production up! Keep it up! Go faster, do more, etc. Company ethics and training classes lead you to believe managers will listen when you have an issue or are uncomfortable in the workplace but when you actually go to them, they completely sweep it under the rug.  I\'ve never worked for a business that has a 3 month long intense training process, doesnt pay for holidays OR provide any PTO, and pays so little for such an intense job requiring so much knowledge. "
Accenture,1eskdvk5hu3cn800,5,Great place to be part if,Quality Assurance Analyst,Accenture be part of. They pay higher that other companies. They offer many course and programs that help you find better projects internally. I'm really honored to work with them . 
Accenture,1esh2jpqct4p8800,1,Political culture,Sr. Consultant,Exhaustive...burnout... Reason being sent on project that were in a mess and the clients were not happy. Toxic environment.

Accenture,1esgkounou56s800,1,Too much kumbaya,Forms Designer,"This company wants to focus on everyone all getting along, holding hands and singing kumbaya.  And they take the side of the client, not the employee.  Being able to work from home was a plus."
Accenture,1eseimerdsaah800,3,Accenture is not how it used to be when I first joined.,Mortgage Analyst,"The one thing I love about Accenture is the environment amongst co-workers (Excluding management). Despite previous management issues, our team as a whole continue to work together and encourage each other to jump over the obstacles we face. With my 9+ years here, I have never seen an altercation between co-workers. With that being said, I feel that there should also be more diversity within management. Unless you are best friends with management outside of work, they do not care nor will help you with career progression within the company. It seems that promotions / lateral positions are only based on who you know in management and not by your merit / performance. With the recent commitment to increase diversity last year, I have yet to see that being applied to all platforms. "
Accenture,1ese95690u56s800,4,Never a dull moment,Management Consultant,Accenture is a great place to grow and learn a lot in a short period of time. Career Counselors provide a lot of support and help you find your place in such a huge firm. Compensation is very fair. I received raises every year.
Accenture,1esdtai7lsaah800,3,Security if work but you wont work there all your life.,Specialist,"The good point of working with accenture is that you're not likely to lose your job and even if the project close they give you the opportunity to start in another project.But, you almost never get a bonus even if working hard because most of these bonus are randomly picked (you still get a chance to be picked if you're working well and get in the selected people for random award) Pressure : Higher everyday, you always have to deliver more and better. Even if the team actually need 10 more people they'll tell you that YOU need to do moreWFH : Non existant compensation for itAll in all, its a good place to start, but dont stay there too long. "
Accenture,1es9bmh51u418800,5,Great team and a place to learn and grow,Tanium Application Engineer,Accenture balance work and life. Accenture provides all the necessary tools for professional development and mentorship. Accenture focuses on a culture of diversity and gender balance.
Accenture,1es8g7lt73ogl000,2,Luck of the Draw,Content Analyst,"I've been a full time employee at Accenture for 3+ years now.I will say if employees voice concerns they are more often than not willing to listen and make adjustments.Their response to covid is to be commended.My only complaint is the quality of management. In the work assignment I was placed I have had the misfortune of getting placed with some very disorganized managers.While, others worked with their crew to get them interviews for promotions I was put on hold trying to get ahold of mine. "

Accenture,1errl9k6vsa66800,1,You're on your own,"Financial Services, Marketing Distribution & Services Manager","Accenture, like other large consulting firms, requires you seek out projects and network for potential projects.

Accenture,1erksuigvo17p800,2,Experienced Hires Beware,Sr. Manager,"I joined as a Sr Mgr experienced hire and was very excited about the opportunity to move into consulting for the first time. Little to no guidance, not valued as an experienced hire except for how much clients appreciate your pedigree. Partners gaslighting, not nearly enough orientation and training, and either 16+ hour days or not staffed on project. Would totally recommend company and industry for recent college grads, but not for those with 10+ years experience without prior consulting company experience. "
Accenture,1eri1m4gf3084000,3,"Large, global company where you will gain valuable experience...",Recruiting Specialist (Sr. Technical Recruiter),"However, unless you have the fortune of working for a great Manager or have a Sponsor/Ambassador, it's challenging to move forward in this large organization. At times one can feel very anonymous as they go about their day (especially on the Operations side). Accenture, LLP is a highly matrixed organization. There will be opportunities for some, but others will not see those same opportunities."
Accenture,1erhf4csdu49m800,2,Lack of supportive and knowledgeable management and supervisors,Prior Authorization Nurse,"Management care more about profit margin and quantity over quality than they do about making sure enough people are hired to do the job efficiently. High turnover rate, making the remaining employees having to pick up the slack. Prior to Accenture take over, the prior authorization department had 100s of employees and great supervisors who were very knowledgeable and supportive, prior authorization and incoming provider calls were 2 separate divisions, and we were given plenty of time (average of 20 minutes) to efficiently review each authorization and rarely had any QA issues. By 2020 there were a total of maybe 25 employees conducting prior authorizations. Each employee is given a maximum of 8 minutes to review anywhere from 3 to 100 pages of non-searchable documents per authorization and are expected to meet daily quota with zero mistakes, while also attending to incoming provider calls, daily meetings, and multiple emails and interruptions. Preceptors will even tell you this is an impossible feat but there is nothing they can do about it. Supervisors are nice, but give bad directions, and when their directions turn out to be wrong, they are not the ones who get the QA miss, you are, and, as management loves to tell you, every QA miss counts against your job security. Management and supervisors themselves are unable to do the job that they expect you to do. Advancement is achieved not by skill or knowledge, but by whether you are friends with management."
Accenture,1erdjap82o2gt800,1,The people working for the company makes the company worst!,Customer Service Representative,Managers do not have proper management skills. They use employee for a couple of months then forget it. Promoting employee for a short period of time and demote them for no reason.

There are no backup plans if something goes wrong.From Mauritius.

Accenture,1eq5s4q9rsa99800,2,Smoke and mirrors,Specialist,"On the surface, Accenture seems like a great company to work for. And, it is a great company if you immerse yourself in the culture, play their games, do your networking, volunteer your time to other roles while still doing your full-time job, and never complain. They tout that their people are the priority and they do a very good job in talking about this - but here is where actions speak louder than words. They do not value their people unless you are a senior manager and above. If you're not, you have to do all of the work, brown-nose and everything else to get noticed and maybe get a promotion in pay but not in title. There are extremely talented people who are stifled at low level positions while higher level roles don't produce half as much work. If you do one thing really well, you'll get pigeonholed into that particular role and never be able to successfully land a role in another area that you might also excel in but just haven't had the chance to show it. It's obviously a good company for many people who have been there for 20+ years but if you are young and energetic and want to truly thrive in your area of expertise while growing and feeling valued for your outputs, then this is not the best place to be.

Take the good the bad and the improvement points and work to improve on them. Do more of the good so you become known for something and do less of the bad and make improvements in learning new skills. Management can be more specific in what they want you to do. Manage upwards and you should do fine. 
Accenture,1eq1ivpfisa97800,4,Stimulating environment,Lead DBA / Monitoring Analyst,Great place to work overall. Management understood workers' needs but couldn't provide sufficient assurances relative to job security and advancement.

Accenture,1eq0akce3sa97800,1,Stay clear unless you're a low performer and plan to stay that way.,Transaction Processing Specialist,"High turnover and the ones left behind have to do extra work while they fill the position for no added benefit (other than being fortunate enough to train the new joiners for free).They boast about the good work/life balance, but that's only for mothers. I haven't been able to take more than 3 days in a row off in 2 years, and I was in a clerk position for most of that time.For the productive employees there's no time for training and enhancing your skills, you'll be busy doing the work of others.Stay clear unless you're a low performer and plan to stay that way."

Accenture,1eolnnj4vs7f8800,3,Great place to start a career,Management Consultant,"Typical consulting firm. The consulting culture wasn't for me, but they help me develop skills necessary to exit. I wish diversity and inclusion was more than just a buzzword. Pay was good and so were the benefits. All in all Accenture isn't a bad place if you want to be in the consulting industry, it just wasn't a good long term fit for me. "

No ""Career Counseling"" or any reference to issues so couldn\'t resolve. Senior leadership poorly managed the personnel and vision with no understanding of how operations function. As a public company, clearly doesn\'t respect the value of the people in lower levels and their contributions.  Out to transfer labor out of U.S. where it is cheap!  "

I\xe2\x80\x99ve been fortunate to belong to long term contracts on responsible, intelligent teams.Job security and advancementIn terms of job security at Accenture, it is very hit and miss with COVID-19. Strategy appears to be being squeezed out as are certain roles within the business."
Accenture,1emqg48slu38g800,1,You are just a number,Consultant/Project Manager,Tough place to work. The only way to advance is to cuddle up with your project lead. I was there 10 years and was recently part of the 25k employee layoffs. Anyone who ever had a blemish during their employment was dismissed.  You are really a number to them. If they can they will outsource the client's employees to a offshore team where they work for pennies on the dollar. If you go to work for them out of college disregard anything the recruiter tells you.  Regardless of your degree your first two years will be filled with the most uninteresting assignments.  If you complain you will receive a poor review and you will be history.  Most college grads last 18 to 24 months. There are better consulting companies to work for. 
Accenture,1emq4bsflu38g800,2,Rewards for those who self promote (but may not be the best resources),Experienced Manager,"Leadership survives on connections and past performance. They don't seem to strive for improvement, innovation, or face the tough questions, instead they surround themselves with yes men.Lots of lip service and talk but very little action once you look under the hood."
Accenture,1empfhbeqo15v800,1,Likely the single worst company to work for,Quality Lead,"80's corporatism in a 2010's suit. Every meeting is filled with false promises or outright lies. Management are out of touch narcissists. Pay scale and advancement is archaic, based on non-existent or unused credential point systems. It feels like working for a pyramid scheme. Avoid at all costs."

I have been given all the opportunities to grow in whichever technology I desired too. The processes are transparent and engaging. "
Accenture,1elvs7pclu1nm800,1,Hardest part of the job,Support Engineer,"The hardest part of the job was to not get what I wanted.  I wanted an IT job, not software development, QA, or not IT-related career.  I knew that they always wanted to twist my career path into the wrong one.   I had my full control of what I wanted for my career and goals.  The two previous roles I had at the company were NOT related to IT.  This was what I wanted to leave the company.  They continued harming people's goals and career plans.  They also needed better leaderships and listening what their employees wanted.  "
Accenture,1elqhfvvou2u5800,3,"Big Talk, Mediocre Walk",Senior Analyst/Consultant,"Accenture is great at selling the job up-front and continues to try to sell you on how great the company is as you work there -- sell you on innovative, diverse, inclusive, and tech-forward the company is. They don't exactly live up to all that talk, and it makes a lot of sentiments shared by leadership come across as empty words and promises that won't come to fruition. The tech provided to employees is fairly atrocious, and its common for you to be asked to deliver work in extremely tight deadlines using laptops that can't reliably even run Excel or PowerPoint. They boast a 1 billion dollar annual investment in learning and development, but it's hard to find materials that actually teach you something new. So if you want to keep growing, you'll need to do it on your own dime. That is, unless you have the right connections because access to different software, hardware, and training is all approved on a case-by-case basis, and what matters most in getting it improved has nothing to do with your use-case and everything to do with who owes you a favor."
Accenture,1elnttplcu2j4800,3,Lack of stability,Senior Software Engineer,"Projects you get assigned to here are much of a lottery I've had some great projects where the team is amazing and fun to work with as well as projects where the entire rest of the team is in a different time zone, which makes working difficult and unmotivating"
Accenture,1eleni592s7l9800,1,Doesn’t like to train employees,Senior Assistant,Was given stuff to work on that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t trained to do then the manager wrote me up for it. Not my fault I was t trained or was given something they should\xe2\x80\x99ve had a member of it do instead of me. They do not pay for parking or compensate those that are required to be in the off e daily when they should. I was paying $400 a month between gas and parking which I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford. 
Accenture,1el0e185no1eg800,4,Productive and Fun workplace,Senior Software Engineer,"Accenture is a great company to work with. Great support from manager/team lead, flexible work hours. Fun to Work at such great company. Great on job learning."
Accenture,1ekprjsmdo1eg800,1,"Disorganized, and disobeys ADA",Social Media Analyst,"I was contracted to Accenture at Facebook. While I do have a disability and needed accommodations for it, they made no effort to give those to me even though it was required by US law. To add insult to injury, they took away my computer, so all the email evidence I had to show for it was taken away. Honestly, STAY AWAY FROM ACCENTURE. They don't care about their employees or your success. All they care about is maintaining their business relationships with big companies like Google and Facebook. They're so big now that they will outsource jobs to other smaller companies if they are paid enough by their clients. Honestly, the company is too big and it's not a place you want to stay at forever. "
Accenture,1ekoteooko1eg800,4,Great Place for a consulting career,Sr. Manager,Best Place to grow a technology consulting career. Find the right practice and surround yourself with good people (there are plenty). Can be very rewarding. 
Accenture,1ekk54tijsa2d800,4,"Up or out, quickly.  Experienced hires at a disadvantage.  Impressive firm.",Senior Manager,"It is clear why Accenture leads the other large consulting and services firms.  Very smart and driven people.  Management has a solid vision across service lines and intelligent org design and people management processes.  There is an intense focus on diversity and inclusion.  It appears they layoff the bottom 10% annually based on utilization - regardless of circumstances and engagement performance.  Seems like people just quietly disappear.   BUT - it's a great place to work if you can find your path and succeed.  If not, you're gone."
Accenture,1ekigdfnlnpj5800,5,Great place to work!,Software Engineer,Great place to work! Very considerate management as we were allowed to work on our homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Truly Human indeed. Hope they can accept me when I try to come back.

Policies are administered loosely and not consistently. There are tons of opportunities to learn and grow, you have to be willing to work hard and earn your place. Be willing to communicate effectively and to cultivate positive relationships. There is a TON of focus on relationships and being \xe2\x80\x9cliked\xe2\x80\x9d which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always jive with how well you perform. "
Accenture,1ekf28the3oh3000,4,Accenture great place for college grad,Specialty Finance Consultant,"I believe the firm is in great shape and an awesome place for anyone out of college to start their career.  For myself coming in as an experienced hire with 10 years of industry experience it was hard for me to adjust to the consulting culture.  After 1 year I am currently looking to leave, I have nothing negative to speak to just not the correct fit for me."
Accenture,1ek48v12b3o71000,5,"Overall great place to work, learn and grow!",Senior Manager,"Joining Accenture as a management consultant was a great move for me that led to a career of over 11 years. In that time I had the opportunity to see a great deal in terms of both client experience and change within the company. This is a fast-moving, adaptive culture that felt welcoming and friendly. It is demanding, but also very rewarding. Movement within the company is pretty easy as they really encourage innovation. This gives you time (and sometimes budget) to work on passions (side projects or interests) helping people grow in entirely new directions. I worked primarily in P&IP and Supply Chain, but ""dabbled"" in HR-related work. Not many organizations offer that kind of opportunity to try things."

Accenture,1eigurh20u1dj800,5,Great place to work,SW/App/Cloud Tech Support Manager - North America,"I've seen some poor reviews and find that unsettling. Happiness in a job is up to me, not the company I work for.  I'm grateful for this opportunity and see my role as a stepping stone to my next opportunity, hopefully that will be within Accenture, but I have no time to view my current job poorly as it took me a long time to learn what I know and try to find something good from every experience.My role has always been remote and I look forward to being able to get into an office to meet others; in the mean time, I create virtual coffee sessions with the team(s) I manage and try to learn more about them than just their job.Life is what you make of it, any company who finds my work valuable and is willing to pay me for it, I return with gratitude, not resistance."
Accenture,1eiec9ohrree1800,2,"Great comp, but easy to get pigeon-holed ",Management Consultant,"Consulting has a lot of politics at play where based on where you're located, who you know, and what you know determines your entire experience at the firm. That's why you'll see a variety of reviews and hear a variety of opinions on the experience. For me personally, I feel like from day 1, I was extremely clear on the things I wanted to learn. I was proactive in developing a network of people in that area and growing skills on the side to help me be better staffable on related projects. However, due to those politics I mentioned, I couldn't be staffed because the client wasn't willing to pay to fly to someone, they were looking for an analyst-consultant with 3+ years of experience (which doesn't make sense time wise), or they found someone more skilled. So as a lower level employee, even though the whole point of your job IS to learn, the firm makes it really hard to do that. Thus, you end up taking jobs in project management or change management and get pigeon-holed in there unless you really make the effort to find a SM or MD to latch onto who can bring you onto their projects. Problem there is the ones I found either all left the firm (should have been a sign about my growth early on) or whenever they had opportunities, I was staffed. So my day 1 goals of wanting to learn a certain set of skills eventually changed as I became less skilled in that area and more so in other areas not of interest. Most people I know want to leave but can't because they don't have actual hard skills that lead to more desirable jobs. I wish I had left earlier on in my career before I got pigeon-holed"

You have to push back when you are at your limit or they will continue to give you more.  You are in charge of your own career so don\xe2\x80\x99t expect someone to just give you a path and/or a promotion.  You will need to request feedback, develop yourself and look for opportunities. Mentor programs are structured and additional informal ones are encouraged.  Biggest complaint is that there is always so much going on and so many opportunities that there is sometimes \xe2\x80\x98noise\xe2\x80\x99 of emails telling  you what to do or offering you something new to learn.

They started getting rid of all full time employees (Some were there 15+ yrs) because they just want contractors now since they can pay them less, give subpar benefits, and can get rid of them any time they want without much warning.They will lie to the new contractors and say you will be hired in but you will not. You will just possibly get another \xe2\x80\x9ccontractor\xe2\x80\x9d title that has a few more benefits.It is nothing but a popularity contest and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t fit in then you will not move up.

If you want a claims analyst job then expect to have no home life and to be pressured and bullied to work overtime every night and every single holiday. If you say no then you will have to worry about being fired. I worked there for over 5 years before they \xe2\x80\x9claid me off\xe2\x80\x9d because it was \xe2\x80\x9ctoo expensive to keep me\xe2\x80\x9d as a full time employee which is what HR told me (HR lost her job too months later) and they had no place to put me (which was a lie). I was quickly replaced by a new DR*GGIE guy (who had been there just a few short months) on our team who was best buds with others higher up and they made him an FTE and put him over a team after saying they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have room and would not have anymore FTEs.

No one would respond to messages, notes from my doctor or even when I questioned what the game plan would be when I could come back. Employees are nothing but replaceable numbers to them. "

Accenture,1eeeaeeh7p1eq800,1,The worst company I worked in 25 years,FERC Financial Analyst,My manager was the worst. She was even threatened by a former employee. The company was forced to change overtime policy by the Federal Government and pay hours exceeded.40 hours. Policy before was work 10 hours overtime per week to expect a 1% to 2% annual raise. All the employees hated it there. I worked 2 years there that I could stand. I would not recommend Accenture to anybody that get a job else ware.

They are a professional consulting business that cares a great deal about their people,  Every day there are new challenges and opportunities.  The hardest part of my role was to find the appropriate skills sets for the Agile teams we often assembled for client facing work.

They paid me enough to justify leaving a good gig at one of the best major refineries, but I hear that's not the case across the ACN footprint.  They kept telling me they need more folks from industry spaces.  And it's completely true, but they won't place you on the right projects that will best utilize your skill sets.  You're even forced to apply for roles outside your practice which takes more than a smile to get on an out of practice project.  There are currently so much talent on the bench at Accenture it's bewildering how ACN pulled it off to hire some of the best collective set of intellectual minds I have ever seen.  Accenture shows complete preference for the ones who came directly from college putting the green peas in the ACN farm system.  It's a good one for ones out of college.  But client industry directors, c-suite, managers, PMO, HSE etc want consultants from industry not right out college.\r People that complain about travel.  Welcome to consulting.  It's always been fly out on Monday fly back on Thursday evening.  Back when I was in sales in the 2000's, it was Sunday to Friday. That was also the consultant world standard in the 2000's.

I wouldn\'t have minded the travel if my boss provided any support, encouragement, and was a team player rather than a ""player."" I liked working at Accenture, but after dealing with an incredibly bad boss I decided to leave. I left the boss and not the company.

Accenture,1e9tmq346ov9i800,2,A struggle for experienced hires,Manager,"The culture at Accenture is antiquated where the consultant is responsible to source their own contract and get staffed.  There is a portal of sorts which list the open positions based on your location, pay grade and required skills.  As a recent grad or someone with limited experience (lower pay), getting staffed is easier since your hourly rate is much lower than an experience hire.\r It is up to the employee to build their own network of Accenture contacts to help find your next engagement.  There are staffing coordinators who 'assist' the consultant with staffing but they simply pass  you resume along and do not actively look for roles.\r Of course in the day of compressed schedules and tight budgets, projects are staffed local first (which makes sense), hourly rate and lastly skills.  So Engagement Managers want the cheapest resource who is willing to work long hours (weekends included) without compensation and without complaints. The Engagement Managers are compensated by their ability to bring a project in on time and on budget which results in a dog eat dog world where you are really on your own most of time.\r If you are staffed on an engagement and fail to meet any deadline you will get rolled off and thrown under the Accenture bus.\r Micromanagement is standard and excepted through out the company.  Emails, as an example must be approved prior to sending to the client."

Always moving forward and teaching innovated ways to stay ahead and ready to provide services.\rEveryday can be the same at times, and then there are days you need to be ready to change lanes. Always receiving support and constructive criticism. Must have a strong backbone and a winning personality. You have the advantage of working with Managers that work behind the name. In other words, in Social Media you may be working a project that needs a whole new accounting department. So you head that up by sourcing and recruiting and setting interviews up for the Manager. Once you prove to them THE FIRST  time how good you are, they request you back and the relationship begins. There are some days that are longer than others until you get the hang of it. You are under a deadline so you have to be a producer."

Accenture,1e2s6de3mocfl805,5,Fully Professional,Senior Manager,"Best Company compare to others best in salary ,work time, Holidays , promotions , paper less work 70% work is travelling.\rGreat management HR that care about their people. Great work-life balance. Excellent people to work with. Leadership's push for continuous improvement of processes, metrics, bonuses, and benefits is great."
Accenture,1e2rbbjfto9r3803,1,Low Salary,Payment Agent,"This company offers very low salary. If you are there you are a number and they couldn't care less if you leave because there is other people waiting for your job. No sick days, no maternity leave, no opportunity for promotions. But the worst of the company is the management. If you have a problem the person above will just say that that it is not their problems and push you on to the next problem until you just quit trying to resolve. Worst of all this company makes a lot of marketing about equality but it is the less equal company I have ever work on, they pay you less if you are from a Latino country, they have a culture of favoritism. Some of my colleagues complained about something not convenient to the company and he was let go after a month. This happens to a lot of people, when they ask why or for better conditions they are just let go. No support to do your job well."
Accenture,1e2pjk8ugo9r3803,5,Great Company,Security Analyst,I really enjoyed my time Accenture Federal.  The culture was great and we had the ability to telework.  The compensation package was great and although our contract ended we were given a severance package.

Accenture,1e2n7dme025jd002,1,Not recommended unless you have no other choice,Social Media Specialist,"They have a tendency of hiring people and telling them they will do one thing then telling them to do something completely different when they start, and wondering why they are not good at something completely different.\r If that is enough, the management, pay, benefits, and location are also terrible for what they ask you to do. For example, some employees with Social media experience where advised not to work on social media clients problems while watching each day as mistakes where made. \r I was asked to work over 300 cases a day within 2 weeks of starting with the company and maintained a QA of over 95%. Despite this, I was constantly hounded for not having a 100% QA and when slowing down to 250 tickets a day to reach 100% QA I was then advised my ticket count was not high enough. All this for 18 dollars an hour where with a similar skill set you could be making 23+ an hour. \r Their promotion program is also backwards advising that people were ""not technically inclined enough for a project"" . After providing this feedback they provided no other information about how to proceed or advance within the company. This occurred on 5 separate instances (people) to my knowledge. Yet, the same people where working in engineering for other companies within a year. They talk about being able to move up, but there is no valuation for skills just how much your manager likes you.\r (Yes, I know my grammar is less then excellent in this review but the company is hardly worth the time for this review. Again, do not join this company unless you have no other options left available.)"

But if your a contractor, you'll have no PTO or paid holidays. It takes forever to get your computer and even longer to get access to your client's systems.

Accenture,1e2cnjr0lp434803,2,Open floor office space that is micromanaged by superiors like hawks,Platform Data Analyst,"The flow of information from project management, to operations management, to team leads, to subject matter experts, to analysts is incredibly poor. There seems to be a purposeful curtain between leadership and the employees on the floor to the extent that sensitive and valuable information is not brought to light until the day of implementation with no preparation to speak of. This seems to be par for the course for Accenture Flex, however is not indicative of the entire company of Accenture."

(mis)Use of Microsoft products definitely affects the work and shapes the inefficiency. Too many MS tools and platforms all very mediocre.\r The illusion of running is really falling forward and getting your legs out in front just in time, same thing.\r They aren\'t investing in internal IT like they should leading to high workload, combined with so much ""process"" that seems to serve a CYA culture.

The work is stimulating, my colleagues are open and friendly, and it is a good place to grow. Unfortunately, the way Acenture Learning is set up, that growth only goes so far as opportunities for advancement are few and far between. And, when there is an opportunity, I found myself competing with hundreds of other internal applicants because the rarity of the event brings everyone out of the woodwork. Though I felt I had proven myself more than worthy of advancement, i was passed over several times for others who seemed to have better connections or were blessed with being staffed on higher-profile projects. While I take nothing away from those who did receive promotion, I just wish the company made more advancement opportunities so myself and the hundreds of other designers wouldn't have to wait for someone to move, leave, get promoted, retire, or die for another slot to open up. But I did stay becausse, despite these deficiencies, this is a great company. I just feel I have grown out of the position and need to make a change so I can continue my growth."

Accenture,1e03c0fvjo1og801,3,Would not recommend working in recruiting at Accenture. Good benefits and pay,Recruiter,"Accenture can be a good place to work if you can find the right team. It is a very large organization and they allow you to work from home. However, the leadership and management especially in Recruiting is poor. There is a lack of support and zero professional development for those who are not aligned to consulting. The management teams are 90% women and they are all of a particular age & ethnicity, so a major lack of diversity exists. It is very much a popularity contest to get exposure and promotion opportunities. Lack of role clarity, recruiters are regularly required to perform tasks far outside of their duties.  Very administrative and there is a major push to hire referral candidates as opposed to having the opportunity to actually recruit top talent."

Projects want experienced hires, so new people either have to take a ton of training before getting staffed or get stuck on a project roles such as BA, Tester, etc. just to not be on the bench. If you want to develop programming skills and you're out of school or bootcamp, more than likely, you won't be coding. \r Management fosters a toxic work culture.

Accenture,1dvnaivukolf2803,1,Duties were completely unrelated to my resume or skill set,Brixton Group (Accenture) / Engineering Manager,"I was hired, I thought, as an information security engineering manager.  As a contractor I was ineligible for onboarding or training in Accenture internal software, to my detriment later on. I never met my manager nor was I assigned to information security duties until six weeks in. Instead, I was assigned to a team of sysadmins, something I knew little about. Nevertheless, I might have made it work if anyone there was willing to assist me or answer my questions, not to be. I assumed the reason for this was that the ""real"" Accenture FTEs were stack-ranked. Eventually I did meet my supervisor and was assigned information security tasks that were challenging and which matched my skill set.\r I did my job well and eventually the senior leadership asked me for direct reports, bypassing my manager. This rendered my relationship with my manager untenable, and at some point he pushed a button and my contract ended."

Never mind that her salary is easily triple what the rest of us make. The company has many support groups and is incredibly diverse, and has a newly appointed female CEO, so they are doing diversity right. Hardest part was the constant criticism and the lack of assistance from leadership. Even for something as simple as navigating Teams or Sharepoint, they will frequently tell you to \xe2\x80\x9cfigure it out\xe2\x80\x9d instead of directing you. The workplace culture is one of constant competition, with yourself and your coworkers, to \xe2\x80\x9cmake a name for yourself\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbe known for something\xe2\x80\x9d.

Accenture,1dssrkddf33nu003,2,"The below is the ""reason for leaving"" provided at the time of my resignation, this is only applicable to the delivery center in which I was located",Procurement Operations Analyst,"It has become clear to me that the center isn't concerned with the company values. I cannot in good faith, work in an organization as superficially preoccupied to mold a perception of value, when I know truthfully, that there are none. Perception has become the driving force of the motivation of the primary leadership at the SAIOC location. The client isn't valued and the KPIs & SLAs, provided at least by my project, are manipulated to hide the failings and direct attention to whatever metrics will satisfy the client. Any notion from subordinate personnel for process improvement is not taken seriously, not just from myself, but other individual's that have improvement solutions are often overlooked. To surmise my experience in the last year, my project seems only to wants its low-level employees to make it appear to the client that there are no problems. The goal being to depend highly on the inadequately developed training program required for the first two weeks of employment on the project. Indications of the inadequacy are derived from new joiners commenting on how little they understood what was required of them and how to perform their job. The strategy to maintain a renewing contract with a client seemed, in most cases, to be reliant upon the decontextualization of the metrics of performance to the extent that it appeared as if the project were providing value. This is easily achieved by the ambiguous nature of the communication between the client, vender and employee and the implementation of the firms' own measurement methodology functioning as an illusory representation"

Some of the management is good (treat people well) but others are horrible the way they treat their employees, so it all depends with what client and department you get a position in."

The director and Sr. Mgr who intereviewed me made it very clear I had exactly the experienced they desired.  I soon learned there was a major disconnect between their point of view and the perspective of those actually running the projects.  It also became clear there were a lot of rules and cultural issues which were never communicated to my by my career coaches (supervisors) or by the HR team who placed people on projects.  Here are the details which support my opinion\r 1. The ""Career Coach"" I had was more interested on how I supported her career than mine.  She did little to coach me or resolve the barrier on my getting onto a project.  after 9 months, when I was transferred to a different group, she dropped me because I ""was no longer able to support her"".  Career Coaches were the masters of my fate and were never reviewed on their ability to be a good career coach.\r 2. I joined as an experienced manager. I couldn\'t get on a project and was repeatedly told it was because of the risk I presented because of  my lack of experience with Accenture\'s methodologies.  This turned out to be a significant Catch 22 as I couldn\'t get the experience.  No one wanted to use me in a developmental role because of the ""cost"" to do so.

The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to know the Partners and their daily needs.

Accenture,1dqsjtteqh3qo804,3,Employees forgotten as contract rolls out,Medical Claims Examiner,"This company does a wide range of jobs, and I work as a medical claims examiner (as a contractor for the company). Earlier this summer we found the account we are currently working on will be rolled out by early next year. Up until that time I feel the company cared about the employees -- were they happy in their work, were their issues with the job itself, how can the employees be productive AND happy, how can we reward those who do their job well and with few errors. This all ended when the contract was ended. The management and team leads no longer care about their employees. If complaints are taken to them, they are not dealt with. If there is too much noise in the bay for others to work, due to non-work related conversations, nothing is said or done. If a person wants to take 5 to 6 breaks a day, again nothing is said or done. The only thing we hear from management is if we have or haven\'t hit our claims finalizations for the day. We have lost over half our employees in our section due to attrition and other job positions, but the rest of us are expected to finalize the same amount of claims as we did when we had a full team. If not we are expected to explain why we haven\'t. We are not given ""atta boys"" any more, or told we are doing well if we exceed their goals for claims each day. This is an excellent company that is international. But their treatment of their employees diminished and then disappeared as soon as they found out we would no longer have the contract. This was my favorite place to work, up until that point."

You can become a senior manager without handwork or even education. \r Politics interfere with work way too much. I left the company because I was asked directly to make the Los Angeles Social Security Benefits Department pay much more and purchase things they don't really need. \r That project was so corrupt that I started questioning whether I should pay taxes. \r Hardworking and gifted employees won't succeed at Accenture.

Accenture,1dohrfdlfh3ph802,1,You will regret working at Accenture,PROJECT MANAGER ANALYST,"I share this with the hope to help people avoid the toxic culture at Accenture. Please consider the following:\r 1) Advancement is 100% nepotistic, your growth and mobility within Accenture depends on who you know. \r2) 0% meritocratic, do not expect for your work to help you advance or give you recognition.\r3) Lie each and every day to clients as this is the Accenture way, if you are honest you will be bullied out of the company.\r4) Group think, there is no room for independent thinking. At Accenture you must follow and say yes to everything managers and team leads say.\r5)Office politics, distrust and bullying are there everyday.\r Salaries at Accenture are the lowest in the industry. The only area which might have ok salaries is in Strategy. Other areas will be $40,000 to $60,000 per year."

Accenture,1dogijenbb832800,3,Stressful/no life balance,Quality Coach,"I think the company itself is good. It offers a wide range of job opportunities but you have to be willing to relocate. The location in Rancho Cordova is quite different. There are lots of office politics, layoffs and unfortunately upper management is not hands on involved so they do not understand your perspective as an employee. Expressing concerns goes unacknowledged. If you want no life, decent pay and no recognition this job is for you."

Like any large company there is a bureaucracy and a game to be played to advance but there is also a fair level of transparency and exceptional opportunity to advance."

Accenture,1dnq2m33oh413801,1,SHADY company! RUN! (San Jose Office),Product Support Specialist,"VERY shady company BEWARE! HR Field Specialist (Human Resources for the company) is too busy showing off her engagement ring rather than handling employee issues and doing her job. She takes everything personal, very defensive, and creates animosity rather than diffusing it. People quit left & right when Accenture Flex took over current contracts. They can care less about you. All they care about is saving money & filling positions. Under this company you are very disposable and easily replaceable! The only employees to say otherwise are those who work for Accenture but not Accenture Flex. TIP: Accenture & Accenture Flex are DIFFERENT! Accenture employees get all the perks. Accenture Flex employees get the bare minimum! You can be totally qualified for a job, yet not get the position. Don\'t count on a pay raise either. Health benefits are expensive! Oh! People don\'t get paid on time; if there are issues with documentation or processing they will not inform you. Huge lack of communication! You cannot speak up, if you do, they will retaliate against you; so watch out for that. So many other companies pay way more for the similar positions and responsibilities. They say they are very adamant with ""conflict of interest"" well, that\'s a lie! Management has an outside relationship that creates a conflict of interest. They are very close friends and regardless if one is in the wrong, they will back each other up. Save yourself some grace and apply with other contractors who pay more and are professional."

For most, you have to go into Accenture understanding their business model - they don't pay well but they do pay fair and they never ask you to do more than what is fair. My professional experience should earn my 4x what I get paid now however, I am at peace with what I earn compared to what I do and what I get.

You may think you're just goofing around playing a game, but you're really training your mind to think more strategically and improve focus. Additionally, endorphins that are released during exercise make you feel happy and more relaxed. Who wouldn't want to be happy and relaxed while working all day. So there you have it, a ping pong table is a great way to make the workplace better. However, ping pong is not the only way to encourage employee interaction and promote a fun work environment. There are tons of ways to improve the office to make it more than just a daily grind sitting at a desk all day. The key is to have something fun that brings employees together and doesn't take up too much time away from work."

Accenture,1dl7im53f24fs004,4,Great place to work.,Capability Development Lead,"Accenture was a great place to work. You had an opportunity to work with people all over the world, and everyone you spoke to or worked with was willing to help out and collaborate."
Accenture,1dl7bihva24et000,4,Neutral Experience,Software Engineer Analyst,There is room for growth\rMake sure find a project you like\rbut it is hard to move around if it is hard to replace you. \rPeople were very nice and willing to help if you ask.
Accenture,1dl5s3b6024f6000,3,"It's the tried and true tale of ""who you know.""",Location Operations Associate,"It's a lie to say that hard work doesn't pay off, because there's value to hard work and a good work ethic. But in a company of this magnitude, there's a lot of competition. If you want to grow in the company, do everything you can to DOCUMENT your hard work. Because when the opportunity presents itself, you're not going to get recognized for being a good worker, even if you're one of the best out there. Keep a paper trail, and you'll do fine. But also just as importantly, NEVER stop networking in the company. Being on friendly terms with the senior manager that you always run into at the coffee machine could be that slight edge you need to getting that superior position."
Accenture,1dl5d2om924e6000,1,Tough to move ahead unless you know the right people,Technology Architecture Analyst,"I've had a somewhat mixed bag of experiences at Accenture. I was on a project for a couple years that I didn't really enjoy and continued to try to get off of it while my project lead extended me without telling me. Once I rolled off of the project, I obtained a Workday certification, for which Accenture is having trouble filling roles since they hired too many resources. Overall, I've thought my two years here were ok and Accenture is a good firm to get your feet wet; however, I wouldn't recommend them if you are looking for a firm with any sort of organization and structure, as the only people that are able to help you end up being just you."
Accenture,1dl4rbom924fm005,4,"This is a great place to work, but a lot of the positions are temporary.",Transaction Processing Analyst,"I really enjoyed working at Accenture. They had competitive pay, a great environment, and decent training. I have learned a lot and made significant growth  in the position I had. The downside, I have found, is that most of the positions here are temporary and although they will try to find you another position in the company there are no guarantees. Before you accept any position at Accenture make sure you know how long the project, your going into, lasted and prepare accordingly. Management has been great with this stressful process and  do really care about the people who work under them."
Accenture,1dl4nvdts24f6000,1,Opportunities for some but not all,Quality Analyst,"Accenture likes to promote that they have work-life balance, however depending on the role this simply isn't true. I worked 50+ hours a week and while sometimes it was voluntary often times it wasn't. I was made to feel like it was my responsibility to work as often as possible and other than overtime I normally received nothing in return. They pay for the lower range of career levels was at or less than contractors at times and lower level employees needed to work Overtime if available to make sure they could afford to keep up with cost of living expenses. \r There was often favoritism in the office place where being in the right social circle meant that you would see new work opportunities as well as advancement opportunities. \r The negatives aside, one of the things I loved about Accenture was their community outreach. They had multiple Employee Resource Groups that did community service from helping with local schools to cleaning parks and hiking trails and that really brought a sense of accomplishment when I was able to participate in those groups."
Accenture,1dl4dvkci24e6000,4,It was wonderful,SOFTWARE DEVELOPER,"I got an offer as an entry level and was able to grow at the company. It required me to travel around the country. Unfortunately I needed to leave the company to take a break for childcare, but if I have any chance I would like to work at Accenture again."
Accenture,1dl393g4l24em000,3,Laid back work environment,Front End Developer,I'd arrive and sit at my desk to work. Very laid back atmosphere. I learned AngularJS and lodash. The hardest part of the job was to set everything up. The documentation was dated and inconsistent.
Accenture,1dl34inps1d17000,4,Great Experience,Sales Manager,"Overall my experience at Accenture has been incredible. It has its own bumps, just like any major F500 corp with red tape. However, the leadership is very down to earth and wants to see you thrive."
Accenture,1dl0rtv8f0mth001,3,Stressful and high-pressure environment,Benefits Testing Associate,"While the salary and benefits look good on paper, there is a dangerous culture at Accenture that is pervasive among the higher leadership. They claim to be a company that works hard to make sure all feel included, welcome, and valued in their roles. Sadly, this corporate company falls prey to what many large companies do--focusing solely on the profits over the people."
Accenture,1dl0399ja24fh002,3,Another job experience,Senior HIM Application Analyst,"This company is about their bottom line. There were good things and bad things as with anything in life. However, there is not much loyalty to their staff."

Accenture,1dkr9h2pl0mth004,4,Great work enviroment.,Team Lead,Management is very thorough to make sure you are having a positive work experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the people I worked with. The hardest part of the job for a new joiner might be the level of accountability and self responsibility that is expected of you.

Accenture,1dko3855d24f1001,4,All depends on project,Consulting Manager,"I have worked in Consulting, Services divisions. Generally speaking ACN is good at Executive management but terrible when it comes to taking care of employees. up or out culture makes things toxic. Too much BS and very little substance most of the time. Overall there are some skills you can learn that'll be valuable. highly recommend getting exposure/experience in this world while starting out career but exit soon thereafter unless it works out amazingly for you. Thick skin development is a MUST. :)"
Accenture,1dkn30sk50mch000,3,Productivity,Senior Informatics Consultant,This is not an opportunity for those that do not want to work. At Accenture everyone has a load of work to do and often times under very tight customer timelines. It is a challenge that I enjoy but many might find it stressful.
Accenture,1dkmgveh024gh000,2,This was the worst job i've ever had,Content Review Specialist,"I did not enjoy my time within this company. Our daily job was to review apps that are going live on Google Play. It was an extremely micro-managed work environment where you had to ask to go to the bathroom.\rI also did not like the fact that every month would present a schedule change. For example, I would go from Mon-Fri 9-5 for January, and February would change to Wednesday- Sunday 10PM-9AM"

Accenture,1dk3bhjgl5j63805,4,Great place to build your skills,Management Consultant,"Accenture invests in their people, but like any typical consulting firm, in order to move up rapidly is to move to another firm. They value work/life balance and have great people working there."

However, pro travelers get to see many places and can enjoy it too."
Accenture,1djsk7ic85nav802,3,"Good on the surface, but you really have to know someone.",TRANSACTION PROCESSING SPECIALIST,"Accenture overall is very diverse and inclusive.

Accenture,1djshp9n45j5v800,1,Nothing More than a report!,Medical Coding Specialist,"You are treated as nothing more than a number, and you are only as good as the touches you received the day before.  In order to move up the ""ladder"", you\'d better not have a backbone and be prepared to beat you into the dirt.  You will be told what to do by people who have no idea how to do your job, leadership does not care about its people."

Accenture,1djnejnoq24f0001,5,The best job I've held so far,CONSULTING INTERN,"I did a summer internship at Accenture, the people and managers I encountered while on the job were the nicest, most genuine people I've met. Teamwork was encouraged and everyone was always making feel others welcome. Even though I had way less experience than the others who were full-time employees and not interns they treated me as an equal and taught me a lot about the consulting world. As an intern, they did a great job of making me feel inclusive, by having us all skype with the other interns at all the other locations (London, new york, etc) and engage in daily activities. Part of my time there was spent skying with other interns, and completing team activities to present to the internship coordinators for Accenture and the other part was spent on an onsite team collaborating on a project for AT&T. A lot of fun outside lunches around the Dallas area were had building comradery. My fellow coworkers were always checking in to make sure I was enjoying my experience there and to date, I have no enjoyed a company as much as I did Accenture. I hope to come back after I finish my degree."

Accenture,1djanke33h3vp801,3,fledgling engineering dept,Supplier Quality Engineer,"On paper, they're a good company. Middle management,  however, does not value or reward tenured employees.

I would never recommend Accenture for anyone looking for a long-term career. From the day that I hit the floor to work on projects until the day that I left my mental health declined rapidly. While they will/do hire those with issues such as depression, I would advise people to only apply if they already have a good therapist that they're going to regularly.

Everyone there is cut throat and only concerned about themselves and their advancement. They have zero regard for the people they drop like flies or how they will be impacted by the sudden lack of income. I was actually sabatoged by a manager at the time who is now no longer with the company. She went out of her way to get rid of the people she disliked for various reasons (personal or other). And she disliked me because I mentioned to another coworker that I refused to kiss her ***, her or anyone. The coworker then told her verbatim my words, as if I wouldn't have said them to her face myself, but it made appear as though I was plotting against her for how the coworker stated it. This person, who also is no longer with the company, thought by throwing me under the bus, it would help her advance. Out of my training class of 30, only ONE remains today. And frankly it's because they use him because he's brilliant. I loved the job itself. I wanted to be hired on permanently and stay forever and would've if given the chance but the drama and constant cut throat, extremely stressful atmosphere made it one of the worst jobs I've ever had to this day and unfortunately, I've had many. I have turned to temp agencies and contact work in my time of need because they hire quickly. While I was still employed there, I watched many people come in and be treated exactly the same or worse. I was bullied daily, harrassed by MANY people in management, the said manager at the time that created all this"

Accenture,1dh4u1aesb86a801,4,A large organization with many different opportunities,Data Senior Analyst,"Accenture is a massive company that has opportunities to learn almost any business and technical skill you could imagine, if you are a strong advocate for yourself.

Accenture,1deiapm68h3l5800,1,Incompetant Management,Java Developer,"Lied to when hired because there is no training. They have a ""refresher"" course designed for people who have already done coding before. Not for beginners. After training they put me in a room and left me for 6 months. No direction, no training, no guidance. I showed up to work and did nothing all day. I guess they expected me to train myself, and just figure it out on my own, which is a tad bit difficult when you are dealing with something that is the equivalent of backwards trigonometry! People are extremely anti-social here, the easiest way I could describe it is working in an asylum level of weird. Would not recommend to anyone, I quit because after 6 months of nothing they wanted to relocate me to an office that had a 2 hour commute. That was their big solution, not training, I\'m sure training would never have helped! Stupidest job I have ever had, stay away!"
Accenture,1debboa4l5nek802,3,Promotions in Recruiting can be a challenge,North America Recruiting,"Overall, Accenture as an employer offers lots of great things to the employees. The company has grown so much in size. I have to say that there are many wonderful people in the Recruiting organization, and those folks are the ones that understand that we have a job to do, we give what we have got during our days and they encourage work-life balance. For recruiting, work from home flexibility is valuable, but if you have been at Accenture in NA recruiting for a few years, you receive minimal pay increases year-over-year and bonuses are decreasing year-over-year, despite performance. You have to determine how much work from home is of value for you and if it is worth staying and not receiving much more over the years. There are limited positions for growth and promotion in NATA, or career trajectory. It feels like Leadership brings many in from the outside and pays them much more vs. encouraging and allowing for high potentials in recruiting to take a stretch role and guiding them along the way for growth and learning. Recruiting leads will have to die or retire in order to ever be considered for promotion, unless you are willing to constantly cheer and self-promote yourself and accomplishments and ensure in the recruiting all hands calls that your picture is up on the deck for recognition and leadership is aware. There are many unsung heroes in NATA, many. Also, performance achievement does not matter unless your lead is willing to fight for you to their leaders to ensure your promotion. And given the limited opportunities, they may not be inclined to do so. It would be nice"

Accenture,1ddmf6o5524e0000,2,Dull experience,Test Engineering Analyst,"I can say that this has probably been one of the worst places I have work. If you want to learn new skills, good luck because it's dependent on what your project uses and if you want to learn anything new you have to do it on your own time. If you're not a 'top performer' then you're definitely not getting a raise. Knew several people who had been here longer than me and made way less. Your performance is basically driven off how your team likes you. Want to work overtime, not going to happen. Nice sense of mob rule and being in a clique one of the few ways to get recognized. Other than that you'll go unnoticed and just be another cog in the machine."

Accenture,1dd5ui1gu5nb6800,3,Welcome to the Hive,"Claims Processor, outsourced project","Accenture is an outsourcing company who partners with corporations who temporarily need a large number of workers to handle projects to help them through transitional periods. A lot of the work may involve complex processing of information. The corporation being served may well deliver intensive training to the hires, which is a plus, and that training takes place in a classroom setting. The productivity demands are absurdly high, in my view. There was an occasion when I was overcome by vertigo from pressing myself beyond my personal limits; it turns out my nervous system reacts that way when my eyes dart rapidly enough to enough places on a PC monitor. The operation is lean on full-time employees.  Management of the group you find yourself in while serving in their temporary work force may change frequently. It can be a good place to gain experience in areas you might not have been able to access before. The main benefits for all the many temps the company staffs are good daytime, weekday schedules, decent hourly pay, and a well-equipped area in which to eat your sack lunch in 30 minutes."

They were honest and upfront, informing the new contract hires that our time at Accenture would depend on how long it took to address the backlog, and that there was a possibility that a few might stay on to become full-time hires.  It was grunt work, but the training was excellent.  The plans were laid out for all to see, and a weekly progress was kept to show where we were.  We ended up finishing a month earlier than planned.  It was a very sharp team.  The few that stayed to eventually become full-time were outstanding recruiters.  The other advantage they had was that even though we were considered remote, they were the ones who often worked out of the Accenture locations.  They built the relationships and had face recognition.\r If you like process driven work, then Accenture is the place for you."

Accenture,1dbvkcjsnb855800,3,Client Based Company,Systems Integration Consultant,"Depending on your client you'll have a totally different Accenture experience than someone at a different client. \r Accenture as a whole has almost no company or independence, people just mold into whatever their client is. Often that can be an experience of switching client every 5 weeks, which is disheartening and exhausting. On the other hand, if you get assigned to a single client and get to stay there it could be a wonderful experience where you get to know others on a team."

Accenture,1dbld79u7b84n800,3,Consummate thought leadership,Director-Cloud Advisor,I joined Accenture with the expressed purpose of re-inventing my approach to selling and business development.  Clients want to speak with client facing representatives who possess a deep understanding of their challenges and who can lead teams that can deliver to a positive outcome.\r To this end I experienced tremendous professional growth as I engaged both in business development as well as in the delivery process.\r It is better to have grown up within Accenture than join as a senior level position in most cases as the organization is Byzantine. \rThere is a lot of non-local travel that takes you away from family more often than not.\r Accenture is a great company correctly perceived as a global thought leader.  The focus is on $30M contracts and you need to have the right network within the firm to associate with those opportunities.

The department that you are in largely dictates advancement opportunities. I work in a very isolated department where it is very difficult to get a promotion. It is a joke that someone either has to die, get fired, or promote for a higher level role to be open. I am coming up on 5+ years and I have increased my salary by a negligible margin.

It also depends on the project you are working on with how positive or how negative your experience will be.  I have found that a vast majority of people I have worked with were amazing.  A couple of projects were literally cut throat and on occasion under-handed but again overall those projects that were managed well, were what made my time with Accenture fantastic.  I do think the pay could be a little better but overall I was very happy there for the most part.\r An area where Accenture could do better is working on the process of finding your next role.

Accenture,1d6otvijn1fdk000,2,Horrible management.,SENIOR ANALYST,"My team of 80+ people had numerous issues with both low-level and upper management. \r Many of the low-level managers were young and inexperienced employees who were prematurely promoted due to accelerated project growth. They were given 80% raises, abused their power, enforced policies they admittedly did not understand or agree with, and lacked proper company knowledge to offer necessary support to their employees.\r Upper management was M.I.A.. Several of my coworkers who had been promoted experienced significant delays in their new pay rates that lasted anywhere from a few months to almost a full year (the managers mentioned in the previous paragraph were all given their 80% raises immediately). I was one of these employees. My manager placated me with empty promises for nearly 2 months before I demanded my raise from HR. It worked.\r There was a lack of transparency between recruiters and employees. Recruiters told employees that our particular project would require a typical 9-5, M-F schedule, but turned out to require a rotation schedule that included weekend shifts and night shifts that ran as late as 1:00 AM. This blindsided numerous employees who relied on public transportation to get to and from work and parents who had children to take care of in the mornings and afternoons. Also, before receiving the job offer, my recruiter scheduled a Skype video chat with me which was changed to just a phone call at the last minute due to ""technical issues"", a circumstance that oddly resembled every single other employee\'s experience who had been hired over the last 2 years."
Accenture,1d6o59bn524e3000,5,Great consulting company to work for,Executive Assistant,"I have learned a lot about consulting industry. The executives I work with are wonderful.

Accenture,1d6gtapb6ak8r800,1,Organizational structure,Senior Management Consultant,It was extremely difficult to join Accenture as an experience executive.

Accenture,1d6b4htv1akgp800,3,High Turnover for a reason,Project Management,"Great company to work for compensation-wise, but there is a high turnover for several reasons.  First, there is little respect for actual project implementation; the focus is on sales.  The folks who actually implement the projects on time and within budget are valued less (i.e., pay and benefits) than the folks who are considered ""thought leaders"", i.e., enthusiastic people who are good at ambiguous business presentations but low on actual technical knowledge."

Accenture,1d5ukkbp4ak4n800,4,Accenture Experience,Technology Manager,Highly engaging company to work for. Takes good care of their people. Difficult to balance internal accenture expectations and client expectations. It is a great place if you can balance these. Hard part of the job is doing what the client is asking you to do when you know it is going to fail. Adamant clients are hard to deal with.
Accenture,1d5t59kdl52sh805,4,Ok Place to Work,Location Services Analyst,"Working here was great until management changed. Then it seemed like communication lacked and my opinions didn't matter. I understand policies change, and I am very willing to make sure work is done properly. But even when I did what was asked in the correct way, I was still blamed for it when it wasn't completed on someone else's end. This is the first time in 10yrs working at this company that I've wanted to look for another job."
Accenture,1d5sd22g35nci800,2,Depends on the job,Client Financial Management Analyst,"The finance role is ver individualistic and mundane as the same tasks are completed every single month.

Not all jobs require travel, but for those that do it can be inconvenient -- especially if you have a family or other reasons why you don't wish to be away from home.\r However, if you're young (or otherwise single) the traveling can be fun -- you get to go to all sorts of random places, meet lots of people, and rack up huge numbers of frequent flyer miles."

Accenture,1d4k9a0jo52t0800,2,Got burnt out faster than anywhere else,User Experience Designer/Senior Digital Analyst,"I did not have a good experience at Accenture.  The work was challenging (in a good way), but project management was poor and never seemed to get ahead of problems before they exploded.  It was a constant state of duct taping things together rather than doing it properly to begin with.  Work hours were terrible.  One of the reasons I got into consulting was the flexibility.  Flexibility isn\xe2\x80\x99t a word I would use to describe my experience here in a thousand years, at least with my team\xe2\x80\x99s manager.  Work from home requests, PTO, sick days, even mental health days required our manager\xe2\x80\x99s prior approval.  Our manager also had no experience in the field our team was in.  We often had to work +60hr weeks because the work our manager committed us to was unattainable in a normal 40 hour week, many times with mandatory work in-office until 9pm nights.  Many people I worked with only cared about getting promoted as opposed to the well-being of their teams.\r Applicant beware.  I could only do this for 2 years before I had to quit for sake of my own well-being.\r Culture/work life balance: 1 star\rAdded a star because pay/benefits were decent, and good work was often rewarded with a good bonus.  But, in the end still had to quit for my own sanity."

Accenture,1d1ecfh1nak96800,4,Great Employer,Accountant,I learned quite a bit about accounting from working at Accenture.  The best part about working there was the interactions I had with many different people.
Accenture,1d1ecc0mfas17800,4,Always learning,"SPECIALIST, CLINICAL DATA MANAGEMENT (BPO)",I have learned a lot from Accenture as they like to cross train often. They take different diversities as a high importance. Advancing is a bit more difficult then most places.
Accenture,1d1e8vcaoas17800,3,Nice place to work.,Financial Analyst,I actually enjoyed working here until another Management that was not my own stepped in. She was looking for advancement in anyway possible. I think she is the major reason our department collapsed. With that in mind the department reorganized half the people in the department. Other than that one employee it was a great place to work.
Accenture,1d1dac8pt0mtu000,5,Most rewarding job experience ever,Senior Manager,"Started with them right out of university.  I achieved consistent professional growth encompassing several roles that provided me the opportunity to apply my skills in application development, project management and, CRM application development. I also had the opportunity to work/travel all over the world with them.  I loved going to work every day while I was there.  I learned how to deal with clients and work on multiple assignments concurrently."

Accenture,1d1c6cnu8ak96800,3,Fine place to work,Customer Service Representative,I was only a temporary worker. But it was fine for the time I was there. I did not really learn that much about the company. I cannot give a review that will be a great help.
Accenture,1d1c0pvlhbrdh800,5,HR Lead,HR Lead,"Accenture does a terrific job of making remote work very successful.  It is a highly matrixed organization, however, they select the right people so the coordination required is done successfully more often than not."

Accenture,1d1a9e816ak95800,1,No reward or recognitions,Client Financial Management Analyst,"Accenture eliminated the annual review process which means high performers fly under the radar and are not rewarded. Most employees get the same raise as everyone else, which leaves the best employees either unrewarded or quitting for better jobs. This place has zero imagination or innovation, the top talented people always leave."
Accenture,1d18gsqjtbrdg800,5,Fun place to work,Collateral Underwriter,I really enjoyed my time at Accenture. The management team was very supportive and knowledgeable. The team members were the best I have worked with. Top notch.
Accenture,1d17a6aqf52sv800,5,Excellent Company,Senior Manager,My career at Accenture has been excellent.

Accenture,1d16tah8iaqgr801,3,not enough autonomy,Technology Domain Architect,"Was hired at Accenture for a role in project management, spent my entire time there writing request for proposals and not getting in front of the potential clients"
Accenture,1d15e9tk4as11800,4,"Fantastic Coworkers, Projects can become black holes",Software Developer Specialist,"Accenture like many consulting firms, have their varieties of pros and cons. One of Accenture's strengths is in the diversity of the people they hire and the environment they attempt to promote. They also have their hands on really cool projects and technologies and the opportunity to learn is there. Their salary structure is not the best and you can easily be under paid and be taken advantage if you allow it. There also projects where management makes it very difficult to advance and also depending on who your lead is, they will manipulate and attempt to keep you at a project you do not want to participate in. TFS staff is essentially useless, and you will find that if you do not have the mentality to survive in a competitive consulting environment, then Accenture is not for you."
Accenture,1d15c3tdobrdb800,5,Good Company,Quality Assurance Onshore Lead,"Good company. Culture with Job security and compensation. Training Job culture.

Accenture,1d154ovr5b89b800,3,Great experience for young IT professionals,Senior Principle,"Can see a lot in a short amount of time. Learn how to work with multiple teams, multiple personalities and balance multiple priorities.  Fast paced environment with a potential for weekly travel. Exciting in that each project is like a new job. High opportunity to meet like minded individuals. Hardest part of the job is not feeling like you can say no to a client. Negotiations are not always win-win."
Accenture,1d14qmb1q0mto000,4,Large company yet they put forth effort in localizing groups.,Developer/Analyst,"This assessment should not be considered as an assessment from a typical employee. As part of an acquisition, the acquired company had employees across multiple countries. Post-acquisition, the group has largely remained intact structurally. So we don't follow the same hierarchy that I believe many other employees do. My work is exclusively remote, so my working relationships are limited."
Accenture,1d0ve3cmc52sv800,1,good training but limited growth,Management Consultant -,learned a lot and well respected by clients but the work is outsourced by clients so the pay is low until you get to manager/senior manager or director and above
Accenture,1d0umbnut52sv800,1,Poor Management,Client Delivery,"No mentorship. Leadership clearly lacks the skills to grow their employees. No clear path as to where your career is going. Instead of growing their team, leaders push their work on their junior team members. Male dominated within the leadership positions."
Accenture,1d0ss09q5aqgr800,4,A day at Accenture,Remarketing Specialist,"Project stabilization can be highly variable and challenging, but it is also highly rewarding - the opportunity to shape policy and streamline teams for efficiency is very exciting, while the work included the role of fulfilling the needs of global clients. \r A standard day will include center around assisting clients with their advertising goals, as well as using extra bandwidth for continued education. While the social media and advertising industries are known for a kind looseness, I feel that Accenture provided the necessary encouragement to focus on my work, produce, and most of all take pride in quality performance."
Accenture,1d0sb1lm652sv800,4,nice but boring,Sourcing Analyst,"I joined the company in December, first three days the was a new joiner orientation, they mostly told us about the company etc. Then I did couple of training of my own using companies learning portal. I must say that job related training looked as if was designed for preschooler-not much info and intolerable for adult."
Accenture,1d0s9fiqi52sv800,4,"Great company vision, policies but rewards are driven by politics",Delivery Executive,"Work is dependent on where you are assigned in the organization. \r Culture is definitely great, everyone does have unlimited trainings and room to grow, there's always a chance for new roles and opportunities however the major deficiency is on rewards. \r Rewards varies by organization and worst case you don't get what you deserve in terms of pay and bonuses. You have to maintain great degree of politics (ie. have really close relationships with group leads) to receive great rewards and most leaders are like this, there are probably small number of leaders that are really objective and sees your value base on your performance and outcomes."
Accenture,1d0r76krfas11800,5,A very friendly work enviroment.,Intern,"Even though I was just an intern, I always felt included. Anytime they had the morning meeting explaining what they did yesterday, what they planned on doing today, and what they were doing tomorrow, I was involved. After learning a lot from these people they decided lunch break and we got to go to the arcade to celebrate my time there and hard work.They made me feel like I belonged there and I was quite sad to finish my internship."

Accenture,1d0lgi7jf0kbv000,3,Good employees but manangement leaves a lot to be desired,Maintenance Technician,My direct supervisor was very hands off and I performed most of his duties while he sat at his desk. Overall management was chaotic and indecisive. Hard to complete tasks when no decisions made
Accenture,1d0lg672q1d1f000,5,Productive and fun place to work,Manager,Every day was a new learning experience. There were a lot of opportunities to travel and work in different industries. The job could be very stressful at times but when we were successful it was worth it.
Accenture,1d0kussdg1agu000,5,Accenture,Paid Internship,I love working here it made me feel important. I learned so many things. A typical day if your assigned a project to make sure that things that are needed to be done are finished.
Accenture,1d0jf6vr4b80h800,3,Horrible Management,Executive Assistant/Office Manager,"If it weren't for my manager and their lack of experience I would have probably continued working at Accenture (I'm still curious on who even gave that person the role).\r Management calling when you call out, even when sick when it's not an emergency, having you take on assignments for another location when you already are managing over 4 executives, not allowing you to work overtime when the type of role/executives who you are supporting need assistance when possible.  \r Stating that you can have a work/ life balance is a total scam.  Even if you decide to have more than one job they aren't okay with that... they expect you to commit your life to Accenture, um no! \r They rely heavy on Skype but even if you walk away to use the restroom, or to take your lunch break, clearly the Skype after a few minutes will state you're away, yet my manager would question where I was and why was I away....ummm I took my lunch break which is required to take in California, or I had to help an employee or I had to meet with the building management.  \r Micro-management is not a successful component of keeping employees staying unless you aren't in fact doing your job and I was ALWAYS doing my role.\r Very disorganized when it comes to new hires coming in to obtain equipment that you don't have in your possession and having to send new hires away (happened more than 4 times within a two month period).   \r When you have well over a high amount of years of experience but younger than the others they act like you don't know how to send a package via UPS or the post office (really comical)."
Accenture,1d0fkfd8g5nch800,3,Not what people expect,RECRUITING MANAGER,Not the same place it was 8 years ago. They are fine with moving people or consultants in and out. No loyalty and limited advancement opportunities.  It was a different situation when I started.
Accenture,1d0fcgopa1agu000,3,Burnout shop,JUNIOR CONSULTANT,I was hired as a recent graduate and it was basically sweatshop. They were just trying to get bodies to charge clients more money. It was stressful while not teaching real development skills.
Accenture,1d0cerue75nch800,4,Good Place To Start,Business Analyst,"Good place to start if you're willing to assert yourself down a specific career path. Most of management is supportive if you have a skill set you'd like to receive more training in.  That said, you have to be proactive about it.  People generally want to see you succeed but if you don't take the initiative, you'll get lost in the shuffle as the company is so large."
Accenture,1d0bba9rn1fdv000,5,Productive fun place to work,Human Resources Manager,I loved working there.  I loved the travel and the team.  The culture was exciting and energized.  There were always changes happening that made for very interesting days.
Accenture,1d0b3g39g1agu000,4,"High performance, well-oiled machine",Marketing Senior Manager,"Enjoyed working for Accenture, except for being asked to do three FT jobs instead of one--impossible to sustain for anything but short-term.

Accenture,1d036ldf01bad000,5,Amazing experience that allows you to be introduced to multiple different industries,Technical Analyst,By being a consultant for Accenture one can be introduced to different industries which can help one choose a more specific job later on.  Management focuses on results and focuses on the employees first.
Accenture,1d01jjefb1d1f000,3,"Good people, stressful job",Analyst,Job is very stressful and involves a lot of customer service that was not disclosed in the initial job offer.

Accenture,1cvt0ihqm1ahe000,1,Not a great place to work,Claims Examiner,I was told I was doing fine but apparently I wasnt. The team leads didnt have the courage to let me go. They had the people that deals with paying me call me and let me go.
Accenture,1cvqvcthq5nch800,4,"Great Benefits and Mission, Lack in Management",Project Lead,"I've been with Accenture for 5.5 years, and have seen a lot of changes. The company is still a very strong competitor, but AFS is having some growing pains. There is more work to be completed by fewer people. I started out as a tester and I'm now in charge of an Agile delivery team. The hardest part of my day is explaining issues that crop up to the client. The most enjoyable part of my day is seeing my team click and collaborate. Overall, I learned a lot from AFS over the last 5.5 years, from testing to product management to client management."
Accenture,1cvotciti1agu000,5,Na,Associate Manager,"Experience is good so far, the no long-term visibility to the employees on  visa program is absent and renumeration is not up to the mark for the employees"
Accenture,1cvm7va3a1ahe000,4,Great people; extremely stressful,Delivery / Sales,"I have worked at Accenture off and on since 1997.  I am continually amazed at the dedication and intelligence of the people here.  The sheer number of type A people breeds a ""work at all cost"" mentality that is both refreshing and very challenging to manage.  This is exacerbated by the fact that, as consultants, customers never call us when things are going well.  This results in a lot of ""hair on fire"" moments, particularly at times when the customer is working (read: weekends).  I think a lot of this is typical of consulting in general, not just Accenture.\r I don\'t want it to sound all bad.  The pay and benefits are second to none. The people are great.  When you have Accenture on your resume, you can go literally anywhere for your next job."

Accenture,1cvdv6ef41ahv000,2,Extremely poor management for content review project,Agent,"This project started out very laid back because of poor management team, when they expanded the project and hired more people, the place turned chaos real quick. Advancement at this company is not based on performance but rather connection. Low integrity and morale. The management uses people at their disposal and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about employees\xe2\x80\x99 wellness, as well as giving false hope and false promises multiple times as a way to \xe2\x80\x9cmotivate\xe2\x80\x9d and taking advantage of the contracted employees."
Accenture,1cv8lpunp0kbv000,2,"Too much ""corporate environment""",User Liaison,"I found Accenture to be racist and unfair.

I am white so I was never the subject of discrimination, but I witnessed it among my friends and co-workers"
Accenture,1cv8hm7ha1aie000,3,Room for growth and learning if you advocate for yourself,Consulting Senior Analyst,"Accenture, like any other big corporate consulting firm has its pros and cons. Its pros include its involvement in the tech space and the leader in tech disruptive innovation. Most of the people I have met have been wonderful and always willing to help out. However, you have to make sure you stand up for yourself and make known what you want. It's too big of a company for people to look out for you individually. The cons include constantly changing policies, barrier to entry if you don't have the right network, and the inability to transfer when you need to."

Accenture,1ctqss11c0kbn000,5,A Great Traveling Job For Those That Like To Be On The Move,Medical Record Associate/ Chart Reviewer,The best part of working for Accenture for me was that I was never at the same office twice unless it was time for the annual audit.  I really enjoyed seeing new faces every day and I love to drive so this job provided me with travel of up to 1 hour on a regular basis.  I liked the general medical office environment and I always prefer working independently on projects and Accenture definitely provided me with that.  I also liked the flexibility in working remotely for some projects too.
Accenture,1ctqrtmomas3b800,3,"Decent pay, no sick days, work holidays, poor mgmt",Content Review Analyst (French),"A typical day is sitting at cubicle doing your work. Resources are easily accessible and co workers are friendly and approachable. Atmosphere is, for the most part, relaxed. Management makes meetings and schedule changes unnecesarily stressful.

Those willing to relocate every few years, including internationally, may thrive and have long term careers with Accenture. If you are transitioned from a role within your company into Accenture by way of an outsourcing agreement between the two firms, understand that your career at that site in now is on a clock You will eventually be replaced. The prevailing attitude is that transplants from outside the US who replace Americans onshore is justified, as Americans ""are the expensive employees"". If you are in the unfortunate position of reporting to a transplant, understand that they have had no management training whatsoever and are incredibly clueless regarding the labor laws in the US. I have literally been told in moments of crisis that I should be prepared to work 24 straight hours due to a so-called ""emergency"" situation. In reality, the crisis was resolved at the end of a 10 hour day, indicative of the fact that the manager possessed no clue how long the team could resolve the problem."
Accenture,1csb3doiiakik800,1,Sucks,Software Support Specialist,So unorganized and rude management. I do not recommend working here. It has turned into a call center environment which was not discussed upon hire. Lied to about multiple things when hired.

Accenture,1cs6vaj9rak7h800,5,The company is good overall,Team Lead,Accenture is a large consulting industry. as long as it is growing the company policy is still followed and implemented. \rsometimes the drop happens when we are based in a client base but the company is trying to improved it as much as possible.

Accenture,1cs5ir6kjas2m800,3,Mixed bag,Accountant,"It's a huge pond, and it's easy to get lost in it.  There are opportunities, but it's important to have someone in your corner, advocating for you.  Sometimes if you're someone who's been with the company for a long time, you can be overlooked by management, and passed over for the younger newer hires."
Accenture,1cs5f67a8b87f800,4,"Decent work environment, with lots of perks",Operations Analyst,"The day to day experience is pretty relaxed.

Accenture,1cs37ac0iakb7800,1,Average worker,SAP Resource Consultant,"The worst company to work for. Can be laid off anytime. No security. Good for GM, and people who are on H1B, or who can cut throat other worker to get ahead. Management is worse. You can survive if you are a member of H1B gang of India. Company is deceiving the US GOVT by hiring too many H1B by backdoor."

Accenture,1crqo5tmtak7d800,5,Great atmosphere,Alcohol Drug Control Officer,We performed admin work during the weekday and educational training for clients during the weekends. We would flex our hours accordingly. Compassionate leaders who care about their employees.
Accenture,1crnsfdh4ak7a800,4,Laser focused on innovation and market relevance,Management Consultant,Everyday at Accenture is different between meetings and focused work. I have always been put in positions to learn new skills and improve my leadership ability. The workplace culture varies depending on the project but is always very positive when attending internal Accenture events. The hardest part of my job is dealing with unreasonable clients and having to appease their needs whereas the most enjoyable is having the opportunity to learn new businesses.
Accenture,1crns8k3eaked800,5,Great Employer,Consultant,"Accenture was a great employer.  They made it easy to keep working after starting a family, moving to a new state and eventually a new country, and managing my spouse's career."
Accenture,1crktc7iq5nb8800,3,I was a subject Matter Expert,Management Consultant,Accenture is an organization driven by changeability and does not in the USA understand how to properly leverage expertise and subject matter expertise.  The hours worked is the key.  it also requires you to build a network internally to maintain your changeability ratio.
Accenture,1criq3bsg52v1800,4,I was able to work remotely,MARKETING SPECIALIST,I enjoyed working remotely and that is the main reason I loved this role. I was able to learn a few new programs such as salesforce which was great! I would work for them again!

Accenture,1crigt4ok5nev800,1,Only great place to work for upper leadership,Application Development Associate Manager,"You are not in control of your career, you have to take the project that is available when you are. This may or may not be the skill you want to advance in.  Expect the roles to have a preference/reserve only for those in the Global Career Program (GCP) who come to the U.S. from India and then never leave.  Not because they have better qualifications or can actually perform the job better but because they are cheaper labor.  U.S. resources are good enough to back fill a GPC when they go back to India for their paid trip/vacation back in home country but not good enough to actually be staffed in the role.  There are many U.S. resources who are more than capable of filling these roles who are not given the opportunity.  Also you are expected to travel 100% ...travel is on your time. They don't care about your outside commitments (family, life etc.)"
Accenture,1crdisu9uake6800,3,"Good for IT Consulting, not much else",System Developer Analyst,"Since Accenture is a very large employer, one\'s experience entirely depends on which project one is on and what sort of team one is working with.  I\'ve had both good and bad managers--the good ones provided great feedback, direction, and discussed long-term project plans and daily tasks with employees.  I didn\'t see much opportunity for career growth and knowledge growth on the positions I was on, and the positions were not stable--I could be rolled off from one project after 7 months and be forced onto a new, unfamiliar one.  Wait times ""on the bench"" between projects can be long for some people but short for others.  Every employee is assigned a career counselor but the CC does not always have meaningful advice to impart.  I am looking forward to leaving the employer and IT consulting field soon."
Accenture,1cr8s5tbdas2b800,4,My First Job,Financial Analyst,I was learning alot from my from work experience at Accenture since I was working at different of Projects and different types of client contracts.  Projects sometimes have very tight deadline.
Accenture,1cr5u30doaki3800,3,AFS: Very poor morale and terrible leadership,Consultant,"This review is for Accenture Federal Services. Upper level management is non-existent and never interacts with employees to communicate with them. As a result, morale is very low, with lots of employees leaving for other, better paying opportunities. Star team members are neither rewarded not acknowledged. They act like they promote training but will put up every obstacle in your way to prevent you from getting that training, especially if it hits their pocketbook.  Employee lunches, snacks, meals, happy hours, etc. are very, very rare. What kind of company doesn't have a Holiday Party? They also canceled the spring gathering this year due to financial constraints. This is a company that cannot see beyond the next earnings call; you are nothing more than a revenue generator to keep their stock price going upward, and you can and will be let go when you are no longer useful. Take a good hard look before working here."
Accenture,1cr5at93q5nau800,4,Good Company,Software Developer,"This was a good company to work for, and I enjoyed my colleagues.  The challenge was finding projects within the company once the initial project I was hired for ended."
Accenture,1cr520hhoake5800,2,Too many politics,Supply Chain Analyst,"This company is great if buy in to everything they want you to. System failures are common. They're too worried about upgrading the office instead of giving fair raises. It's not how much or what you know, it's who you know that gets you through advancement."

Accenture,1cr0sdlalas26800,1,Poor training,Claims Processor,Training was poorly done. And each time we would be trained on something it would change. The supervisor I had wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very knowledgeable. You were trained by people who never processed claims.
Accenture,1cr0prqedas26801,4,Job was good.,Executive Assistant,"A typical day at work was fast-paced, I learned how to work in a large company. The workplace culture was staggeringly different [big company vs. small company].

Accenture,1cr0a1bu2akam800,4,"Great company, great people, great work, pay is mediocre",Group Design Director,"This is a company that values hard work and there are many like minded people there.  However, if money is important, they tend to pay less than anywhere else comparable."

Accenture,1cqltlsitas26800,4,Stagnant Support Personnel Situation,Senior Leadership Assistant / Analyst,"Generally, if you are in the support level you have an HR option for promotion or nothing. If you choose the tech roles those are always possible but one must be comfortable in the support role and not look to advance.\r The only chance for change is to have senior executives added to your desk. However, there is a bit of a ""who you know"" issue there - if you are an introvert you will not do as well as others. You must ""work the system"" so if that isn\'t comfortable prepare to languish."

Accenture,1cq7g7hbgb8af800,2,Good and bad about being a contract employee,Client Service Specialist,Management was great.  Work was challenging.  How absences and tardies were counted was not fair.  A typical day was taking up to 80 calls and assisting however possible.
Accenture,1cq7644dlak6j800,4,seems to work for some,CA Gen Developer,"For me, working at Accenture was mostly a pleasant experience.  They have a pretty good reputation, as far as I know.  I worked at a client site, so my experience with the work environment is limited to what the client wanted.  I was mostly happy with management, although sometimes felt a severe disconnect with upper management, or what things are like at other Accenture locations.  Most of my coworkers were happy with Accenture, but there were some instances where there were issues with the customer or culture at the location, because of it being at the client's facilities."

I have traveled extensively for work and have been able to work on analytics transformations across industries.
Accenture,1cq02kg6uaqhq800,3,"Solid Company, terrible work life balance",Recruiting Coordinator,"Accenture certainly has a great reputation in the business world and rightfully so. They do quality work for all of their clients and lead the consulting world in the tech space. On the negative side of things, this comes at a sacrifice to your work life balance. Expect to be working 60 - 80 hours a week regardless of what area you work in."
Accenture,1cpvu9qqe5neb800,5,Great consulting firm that really 'walks the talk',Manager,"First rule of any massive firm (400k + employees at last count): You need to find your place. This may take 1-2 years as you move to different projects or clients, but it is possible. If you don't love your first assignment, that is normal. Everyone comes out the other side with a few crazy stories to share. \r I worked in Tech Consulting, which is what Accenture is known for and where they beat the competition. Other branches (like Strategy consulting) are growing but not as big or prestigious as other firms (think MBB). \r I lucked out and found a great manager on my second project, and then worked with him for the next 5 years. Good people attract one another, so this is key to being happy at Accenture. \r The culture is totally merit based- analysts will be included in C-level meetings if they are dirven and smart, and likewise managers will be left out if they are slow and lack drive. Not a true up-or-out culture, but people can get complacent and will get passed over for promotion."
Accenture,1cpvaanhdakhl800,5,Cutting edge company with lot's of opportunities,Manager,I worked for this company for 15 years.  I had tremendous experiences with lots of opportunities to grow.  I had great  mentors.  It can be travel intensive depending on the position.

Accenture,1cpacde3aas1i800,3,Great Place,Senior Consultant,Based on our line of work we could not find a proper placement in the corporate departmental structure.  This hurt us during performance reviews as each department head prefered to promote their own team members
Accenture,1cpa5ba0r5ne5800,1,They don’t recognize or reward good employees,Business Analyst,"Accenture eliminated the annual review process which means most high performer fly under the radar and are not rewarded. Most employees get the same raise as everyone else, which leaves the best employees either unrewarded or quitting for better jobs."
Accenture,1cp5e0b2p5na5800,4,Good experience for people starting out,"Associate Manager, Instructional Design","As an experienced hire, did not have flexibility or opportunity of a hire out of college.

Accenture,1cp3b3t9eas1i800,3,Relieved when finally laid off.,Mortgage Support Analyst,When Accenture assumed Zenta Mortgage Services it looked promising.  Soon lay offs were constant.

Accenture,1cotfss6gakhb800,5,Excellent Company but depends on the project,Technology Consultant,"The opinion varies from project to project; my experience with my project was excellent however. Have a supportive team and great lead, and was able to learn a lot both from my peers as well as on my own. I was challenged and trusted me with major projects that would be deemed crucial for our client. The only downside would be the lack of opportunities to work on the technology you want as demand by the client is always first."
Accenture,1cot9scpnaqhd800,2,Not for People people,Management consultant,"There is a vicious dog-eat-dog atmosphere on teams who are all ranked against each other.  Project managers can be immature and self focused.  I met too many people from the same business schools, an interior clique.  They have rarely held any kind of corporate position that is not in consulting, therefore ""real life experience"" doesn\'t exist.  I heard these consultants insult and demean the clients behind closed doors.\r Nothing seems personal at all.  HR problem? Website.  Health problem, fill out a form, then call a number and talk about your health with strangers.  Need documents? You can\'t down load them for security reasons.. Need a in-person meeting with your boss? Wait a few months.  They hire tons of people then dispose of the ones that aren\'t in line with the very selfish, very egotistical culture. \rThere were a few bright spots, but not enough to keep out the darkness."
Accenture,1cot3etrt52u5800,4,Great work environment,Auditing Specialist (Contractor),I enjoyed my tenure at this position. The managers that I encountered there continue to assist me with my career. It was a great entry back into the corporate environment.
Accenture,1corgaobobrdv800,3,More a resource than a person,Consultant - Senior Business Systems Analyst III,"I felt like I was more of a numbered resource than an employee, or even a person. My manager, Career Counselor, and Talent Fulfillment Specialist ignored me until the contract ended. Then, I did not feel like the attention was on finding a role for me, but rather getting me placed somewhere that I could bill a client for time."
Accenture,1coqthft45j5s800,3,Success is Largely Dependent on Team,Business Operations,"Processes, rules, and regulations are not streamlined across the company. Largely dependent on type of team as well as leadership within team. Great company to start off with out of college. Health insurance provided is good. Work life balance depends on team and type of work."
Accenture,1coqnuhcr5na2800,4,Great Experiance,Instructional Design Contractor,"I loved working for Accenture and had experience working in several areas, including Technology and Interactive. I found Accenture to be a dynamic, forward thinking company and there are great opportunities for growth and learning. I've never worked with so many smart people!\r Accenture is growing so fast, (too fast in my opinion) through acquisitions and a focus on the future trends that it can be overwhelming and downright confusing to navigate. It can be tough to find your place in the organization, and once you do it is likely to change. You are likely to work very hard, it can be fun and rewarding, but I've known people to burn out. \r Currently in 2018, there is good job security, but there is a risk that things are growing and changing too fast in some areas and there are signs that there may be reductions. \r Accenture used to be more focused on developing a liquid workforce, by leveraging contractors to help support this very dynamic environment. The most talented individuals also seem to moving on. From what I have witnessed, the loss of these people is affecting the ability for Accenture to be agile. \r In summary, if you are looking to join a dynamic company that sometimes has a feel of a small agency, this may be for you. Some areas are really hard to work for and it can be hard to find your niche. Depending on your role, this is a great company to start your career, but may not be right for those who wish to balance work and family. Be aware that things may be changing and the company is feeling less agile and less dynamic than a few years ago."
Accenture,1copituiiak9u800,4,Good place to work,Software Engineer,"As it was my first job, I learnt a lot from the company.

Accenture,1coe48o695ne0800,4,The good and bad,Software Engineer,"Much is luck. Looking for projects on your own in a 400,000 plus employee company means stiff competition after getting hired. Each project ends leaving the employee in the same vulnerable position of a job seeker. Time on the bench is counted as mostly unproductive since you are not billable. One can shine only while they are billable. So its like being a freelancer while being employed in a company. There is little help and structure when it comes to finding projects. The systems don't work the way as they are designed and its much more organic and in Brownian motion that in should be in my experience."

Excellent place to fast t,Software QA Tester,Not unlike most global organisations - tries to provide their people with opportunities to achieve their best. \rThe challenges\rExceptionally long hours where salary is not commensurate with degree of effort required. This is somewhat counter-balanced by the type of work employees are engaged in often being very high level problem solving and rewarding work. From my experience the offsite workforce business model places tremendous pressure on employees based in Sacramento and adds to the enormity of the task but this is not uncommon throughout global organisations.

Accenture,1cmhfgd1lak579ag,4,"Invaluable experience, but time you will never get back",Systems Integration Consultant (Team Lead),"The culture is simple in consulting. A salaried employee is just that, you get paid for eight hours of work a day, but you might work ten hours to get something done. Deadlines don't care if you're not being compensated for your time.\r Being a traveling consultant is fun up front. Amazing even. I've seen quite a few places I likely wouldn't have visited intentionally. The back end of this is that eventually it gets old. Getting up early to leave Monday and make that initial commute is cumbersome. On top of that, they may ask you to stick around until Friday instead of Thursday. But such is the lifestyle of a consultant. Client needs are always priority.\r Advancement has been decent. Accenture changes their policies every so often shifting people into new dynamics and new titles. On the job training is a sometimes available, but only in cases where your initial skillset is needed. Meaning that you'll typically have to enroll in a course from the Accenture learning website to get trained on a particular tool. Self study is always your best bet anyway.\r Management varies just because going between projects you always have a different set of hands on the wheel of the ship. Sometimes they're great and the ship sails unbelievable smoothly. Sometimes the sails are on fire and the only thing keeping us a float is the fact that we've already run aground."

Accenture,1cmg77m7makck995,4,Productive work place with a lack of work/life balance,Client Financial Management Analyst,"I worked as a client financial management analyst. While the work is interesting, it can get dry at times. I was hired on as a contractor and promised multiple times I would be hired on through Accenture. I was never hired on through Accenture. Throughout the course of the work week, I was told last minute that I would have to work at night or on the weekend. The work is constantly stressful with managers expecting everything to be done instantaneously. Accenture is a great company, but be careful of what you get yourself into."
Accenture,1cmb3icp95n97f5t,4,Depends on your client/team,Product Management,"Accenture is so big and diverse in its roles that it really is a case-by-case basis. In my case, I got really lucky to be on a great client in a role with more responsibility than is normal for my level."

Accenture,1cm64gahh52t4b4l,4,Accenture is a great place to work if you get into a good dept.,Human Performance Manager,"I've enjoyed my time at Accenture and have worked in 3 different departments. As a company they have high goals and try to achieve them but sometimes as an employee you're the collateral damage. Promotions don't come easy and bonus are not a lot, typically less than 5% of salary if you're not a consultant. My advice is try to negotiate your salary upfront."
Accenture,1cm3q3ivkakcg82f,3,Strong Learning Environment,Senior Manager,"Great learning environment where you can learn leading-edge strategy and business consulting.  Work hours are, as expected, extreme and the day does not end until the work is completed.  And be ready to travel extensively in most cases.\r Good team management and program management methodologies.  It is a good company to start a career because of the key programmatic skills and capabilities that Accenture develops.  The learning curve drops off quickly as you reach the Manager/Senior Manager level.\r Accenture is now a massive organization with 425,000 employees.  It\'s hard to maneuver and ""connect"" appropriately.  I sometimes found groups doing similar solution development or service delivery, not talking to each other to know what the other is doing, and not wanting to cooperate to provide the best services to clients...rather it was a game of ""revenue for promotion"" vs. what\'s best for the client.\r Probably the biggest frustration as you advance to Senior Manager level is that mentoring and growth stall.  Accenture has a difficulty with mentoring the SM level and coaching/improving the SM level to greater capabilities.\r The term, ""meritocracy,"" if applied correctly is a great aspiration. \r I found that is was equivalent to being ""chosen"" and ""favored"" vs. promotion based on work quality, client satisfaction, publishing, sales, and other attributes.\r When I left, one of my main clients told me that they felt Accenture never really valued what I brought to the table and how I helped clients through their issues and improved operations."
Accenture,1cm16qmueak909ql,3,It's a decent job but has poor advancement opportunity,Customer Service Specialist,"When you think of typical corporate culture, you get Accenture. You are a cog in the machine here, and even if you work hard to stand out management doesn't really recognize it. If I were on a different assignment maybe I would think differently, but it feels like this is a very big company that isn't all that interested in investing in its people."

Most teams are run 1-3 people understaffed to save money and pushed beyond their limits leading to quick burnout and people quitting. I wish the pay was hire and they hired better managers, too many internal promotions and no new ideas from external hires."
Accenture,1clv9r0gn5nd0bvq,1,Not good for entry-level positions,Client Financial Management Analyst,"The culture is terrible. \rPerformance reviews are a joke. They are based on peer feedback where anyone can fabricate anything about you, even if you are a contributing more than your share of work & dedicated to the customer. So, watch your back. Something is very wrong with this company, stay away until they can learn to manage their people better. Management is sloppy, disrespectful, uninspired and mentally checked-out."

Accenture,1club6sl0ak50f13,2,Disorganized and no Advancement,Oracle Systems Developer Associate,"A typical day is without work to do.  You are expected to use this time to study a very static tutorial site with no certifications or recognition.  \r On busy days, as a developer, I copy and pasted technical documents to create new ones.  This is about 95% of the job.  I used Java/SQL, my primary skills I was hired for, only a handful of times working there.  \r Management amounts to people telling you to ""get it done, no matter what it takes"".  They tell you to use resources (people) to answer your questions, but often those with the information you need are too busy to help.  You are often stuck in work limbo due to this.  Leads are overworked and are often the only people with crucial information you need to work, but they will not have time to give it to you.\r Workplace culture is very loud and bustling.  The leads are constantly on phone calls or barking at whoever is nearby.  They hold parties quite often, so you will get your fill of foods and drinks.  The break room is very nice and well stocked.\r The hardest part of the job is advancement.  Without work to do in your field, you are unrecognized among your 100 or so peers.  \r The most enjoyable aspect of the job is certainly the life/work balance.  You can call out almost whenever you want, especially if you need it.  \r Also, the job itself is quite stable.  If you lose your position, they will hold you for 2 weeks (often more) and give you resources to move to another position.  The other positions are similar.\r Ultimately, it\'s a workplace that will keep you for menial labor and attempt to dazzle you"
Accenture,1clsni52k5j4tetc,5,Employee friendly work environment,Technical Lead/Architect,"Accenture has been an amazing workplace for me so far.

Accenture,1clkv2qt31aht10c,1,What’s going on??,Software Engineer,"It seems like this company is not innovating anymore since I joined. It\xe2\x80\x99s a constant race to watered down vanilla from an over-bloated/risk averse founding culture that keeps on promoting from the same ol founding pool. These managers and directors will continue to guard their multi-millions into their golden retirement at the expense of shareholder/client value. That's what happens when the fox runs the hen house. There is no regard for the average lower level worker at Accenture, we are just a number in the machine."
Accenture,1clkumh9l5n909tf,1,Hands down just awful,Analyst,This place is filled with bad managers that create a terrible working environment for people right out of college.

The only thing missing is the bell ringing at the end of the day.\rOpen floor space, can be distracting. Very noisy. Lots of cross-conversations can happen while you're on the phone and people are willfully oblivious to that.\rManagement's philosophy is to continuously give you feedback, whether you need it or not. Feedback overload is inevitable and leads to many data points that don\xe2\x80\x99t add up to anything when you ask for a raise or promotion. \rYour co-workers are classified in two categories: The arrogant spoiled brat, and the naive just out of college techno guru who relies exclusively on data and technology and not much on common sense.\rThe most challenging part of the job is managing your 8-hour day with meetings, appointments, reschedulings and administrative tasks, which according to management should only take a few minutes of your day.

Accenture has a strikingly different culture that is noticed immediately if you\xe2\x80\x99re an experienced hire coming from another large company.\r I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen anything like this before. \r HR  and employee management tools are so antiqued that I\xe2\x80\x99d bet they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even quote an accurate headcount. Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s why they were one of the first companies to eliminate the annual review process,  because they simply can\xe2\x80\x99t track employees?\r Despite what upper management says about the place I like to let the numbers speak for them self.  Just ask the 20 - 40% (estimate) of ship-jumping employees that have departed certain teams recently.\r Most senior managers are stagnant bodies, indecisive and just sit there collecting a paycheck.

Then when you have free time you can go through their learning website to further develop or learn more skills. \r Management can be a mixed bag depending where you end up in but a lot of them value your growth in the company and can help you further advance inside the company.\r The work culture there is fantastic, you can talk to your colleagues like they were your friends and some of them can end up being good friends. They are all eager to help you out and you can feel there is a sense of camaraderie within the team.\r Hardest part of the job was the Work/Life Balance of the company, they encourage Work/Life Integration more.\r The most enjoyable part of the job is working around people with the same mindset as you and it feels like you can enjoy your job even if the going gets tough."
Accenture,1ckvb6vkcak4nfhk,1,Accenture is a very unstable revolving door type of operation.,Program and Project Manager,"Accenture operates under a consulting type process where the young with little experience and offshore employees who work long hours for less than market average base pay.  The employee turnover rate is more than 25% per year when looked at on a long term basis.  There are small numbers like me who have made it for a couple of decades, however, the vast majority don't.  Since most employees work on projects with a limited horizon, you are constantly in search of the next role, and when projects are cut short, many are searching for new roles at the same time which causes employment jeopardies at each role change.  For those who wish to remain employed, each role change brings a few months of adjustment, usually six, and an intense learning curve to come up to speed in each new role, which also puts off vacation plans during the adjustment period.  \rYou also can never relax since you have to be the best of the best at all times and make sure clients notice."
Accenture,1cktstdsr5j4la5e,1,Demoralizing and talent draining,Accounts Payable Specialist,"Do not ever apply for or accept a job at Accenture unless you want your career to end. Accenture hires top talent and then places these individuals into positions where they have limited responsibility. They boast having numerous programs and initiatives to grow talent, but those offerings are just for show. After spending several years at Accenture you will become institutionalized into how they do things. No other company operates like them and you will have a hard time finding employment beyond Accenture much less competeing in the job market.\r Their compenstation program is set up such that they limit the annual raise to a max of 5% and also have rules in place that slow your salary growth down as you progress in your current job level. Wealth limiting! They boast that they pay for performace, but that could be further from the truth."
Accenture,1cktsc4vpakglfhg,1,Run Fast Away From Here,Client Financial Management Senior Manager,Unethical people. The worst place in the world to work.\r A typical day at work: stress without the resources to solve problems and absent minded co-workers \r What you learned: move on asap when in a hostile work environment\r Management: cowards and losers \r Your co-workers: back stabbing cowards\r The most enjoyable part of the job: not working there
Accenture,1cktrrt6oakclfsv,1,Bad leaders,Data Analyst,"Accenture Federal is a poor place to work. Management is more interested in replacing the experienced workers with college hires than they are with being able to meet deadlines and put out a quality product. The most experienced managers that made programs  made programs successful were laid off in order to replace them with college grads who have no loyalty to the company. The new kids would be leaving after a couple of years just to go after the higher paying job. \r Benefits suck. Where the health insurance used to be top notch, AFS decided to manage their own program, hence huge copays, out of pocket and premiums. This was before Obamacare. And vision care was removed. \r No, this is not a company you want to work for if your goal is job security. No one is safe from the stupidity of management."
Accenture,1ckrgmg3v1ahv7nq,1,Bad sr managers,Portfolio Manager,Consistently lied to and about by Sr Management. Did not keep promises and ignored talent within their organization. Consistently placed people in a no win situation and would then blame them when something went wrong. Would give unethical directives and when the customer found out they would use you for the scape goat and terminate your employment. Tried to do too much with too little and expected people to put in 60 to 80 hours a week.
Accenture,1ckreld615ncj875,1,Not friendly towards H-1B employees,Cloud Engineer,"This company has policies that target H-1B employees. They are less responsive than they used to and will not help you with any processing or help guide you through the process like promised. Very disrespectful and cold. They treat foreign H-1B visa employees like animals, shipped around to what every project it needed we are treated like second class employees. Just terrible. Do not work at Accenture, all you are is a resource to them, a warm body in a client seat generating revenue."
Accenture,1ckqnape9as0ibta,5,Great Project Experience,Management Consultant,Accenture gives it's employees a great platform to learn and grow on multiple projects to develop a sound experience in industry.  It is a great place to build your career.
Accenture,1ckoolh7j1aif2fc,1,Dumpster Fire,Business Operations Manager,What is going on with Accenture Federal services. The teams are so short staffed and disorganized. I think  this organization a disgrace to our national security with some of the worth they do. The staff turnover is so high that we can even preform adequately
Accenture,1ckoo4om75n8jdum,1,Stay away from this company,Project Accounting Analyst,"They hire people right out of college and attempt to work them to death and make work the only focus of their life, encouraging them to stay late and order dinner and eat at the office (non reimbursed).\rEmployees are forced  to do volunteer work on certain holidays when they would rather be with family. \r matrix manager structure means no accountability to the worker doing your review process, backstabbing culture"
Accenture,1ckomu39s52sjfm2,1,High Staff Turnover,Technology Analyst,"Extremely high staff turnover. Every month people are leaving or starting in staggering numbers. The high level of turnover is forcing them to desperately fill short staffed teams with unqualified associates. It doesn't take long to see why the office has extremely high employee turnover rates. After only three months of working at Accenture, I felt like I had worked my entire life in a tedious dead-end position with no opportunity for advancement. Low-level managers are inept at handling anything before it becomes a pressing issue, and constantly display their lack of concern for employee development or support. Analyat and administrative roles are expected to immediately handle the fast-paced work environment without any training. Top-down communication is terrible. All too often, employees are not aware of policy or process changes until they spend hours on the phone trying to fix an issue."
Accenture,1ckoj4udkb80h8gd,1,i was harassed by this company,Service transformation Consultant,i was harassed by this company. its a waste of time. It treats employees on H1b very badly. It does not provide salary slips.It is very similar to desi consulting and
Accenture,1cko71p0aas0iafl,3,Strong Team Members,Director & Senior Solutions Analyst,Skilled team of co-workers.  Employment was the result of Accenture acquiring our company.  Company culture differed significantly.  Good medical benefits.
Accenture,1cknfaeug5j4h9a1,4,Great place to drive innovation and value for clients,MOBILIZATION / TRANSITION MANAGER,"If you want to learn and be around smart people, this is your place. Not only do you get to be around smart people, you also work together to deliver smart solutions for clients."
Accenture,1ckig89b15ncja9n,1,Sinking Ship,Finance Analyst,"Working for Accenture has been a lesson in broken promises. Teams are consistently understaffed and Team Leads and Managers are also in short supply as they keep quitting! My team has experienced an 80% turnover rate in the past year and a half. There is talk of promotion and upward mobility, but it NEVER happens because so many managers are quitting before they give you a proper annual review, so you have to start all over with a new team and new manager. It is an infuriating cycle that\xe2\x80\x99s getting worse. There\xe2\x80\x99s  no consistent support for recent hires as most are just thrown onto a project with no training. Analysts are given unequal grading by HR and people with in-demand tech skills are allowed much more flexibility and better reviews to keep them around. Rules for annual goal setting and annual reviews are EXTREMELY unclear and in constant flux without notification. The disorganization at Accenture is indescribably bad. I don\xe2\x80\x99t recommend this place for people right out of college because there is no clear advancement track."
Accenture,1ckhc2j2k5n8jds5,2,Short term contract basis,Quality Assurance Software Tester,"Short term contract, then you have to calculate taxes by the end of the year.\r The work schedule was chaotic, from 9 AM to 11 PM,\rsometimes they provide food.\r There is flexibility to work from home, but mostly\rthere are mandatory meetings even during holidays.\r Hardest part is that it is time consuming."
Accenture,1ckh1ajvd1ahd3jt,1,Got out as soon as I could,Pricing Analyst,"Very likely that different groups comply with the culture that the firm as a whole likes to promote; my personal experience is that it's only talk. Managers were absent with guidance but present only to criticize, were hardly present at the office, did not connect with staff even online and specifically said they were not interested in training anyone because of lack of interest and patience. Counselors provided vague advice and even encouraged negative reviews followed by apologies for such encouragement. People in my group said one thing and did the opposite it was such a terrible experience working here. Management is so clueless and ill equipped to manage a corporate team. I think a complete refresh of top management is needed."
Accenture,1ckguqcd51d1f3lb,2,Just awful,Digital Marketing Manager,"This company is not a place for older people. There are so many Campus Hires who are overly coddled, and micro managed. There are way too many meetings and training sessions and unnecessary counseling sessions. This company puts numerous obstacles in the way of actually giving quality financial services to their clients. There isn\'t a day that I don\'t go to work and beg to ""Just let me do my job!"" I\xe2\x80\x99m constantly bogged down by the level of talent here that only consists of young college grads with little experience and find myself training more than working. I get it that they are cheaper labor but the end result is a bad outcome for our clients."
Accenture,1ckgu57kqb84hd69,1,Material weakness in culture/values exhibited by low to mid level managers,Federal ServiceNow Analyst,"Great company that is marred internally with an overabundance of non-inclusive activities and purposeful de-railing direction provided to employees by senior staff and managers guiding them and always moving the goal posts. There are significant deficiencies in both experience and maturity to handle a supervisory role in a professional manner for all low level managers that were recently promoted out of dispare to keep them from finding a better job. Most have ZERO formal management training. This is an ego-crushing environment where your self-confidence will be frequently challenged and eroded. This is an extremely hostile environment with young, inexperienced players in management positions."
Accenture,1ckgrb0mlak4h804,5,Positive work experience,"Spot Buyer, Expense/AP Analyst",Mostly project work where my skills were developed and enhanced.  Fun and friendly work environment with numerous talented co-workers.  Accenture provides a huge balance of work and life activities.
Accenture,1ckg7c6otas0ibnp,2,Bad annual review process,Java Development Analyst,This company is so unbelievably incompetent they cannot get rid of their poor performers because they have no way of identifying their poor performers. Employees get shuffled around from project to project or even promoted if their boss thinks they are incompetent because it's almost impossible to fire anyone. A few years back Accenture ended it\xe2\x80\x99s traditional review process to opt for less formal \xe2\x80\x9cdiscussions\xe2\x80\x9d which are not helpful and provide to tangible feedback. Low performing employees get the same raise and bonus as high performers. Promotions are seniority based not merit because of these \xe2\x80\x9cdiscussions\xe2\x80\x9d and many times it\xe2\x80\x99s just a popularity contest.
Accenture,1ckg6o3a55ncjciu,1,Challenging culture and poor leadership,Business Data Analyst,Senior leadership does not have a clear line of sight on corporate objectives. Priorities shift excessively without accountability making teams confused and unmotivated. Fire drills and chaos reign at Accenture.
Accenture,1ckg5f19o5n8j90m,1,Accenture is littered with terrible managers,Technology Analyst,"Many people are unmotivated, not because they have a great reason to be, but rather because their leaders have not given them a great reason to be motivated & engaged. Engage and motivate your people or the turnover problem here is going to get worse. It seems like everyday talented employees are leaving because Accenture does not have transformative and inspiring leaders."
Accenture,1ckdjbm9m0kbu5nt,5,Global and Productive,Service Delivery Team Lead - Processing,Accenture is a wonderful place to work.  They have courses you can take for free to help your own growth potential.  They also have wonderful benefits and working conditions. \rThe only negative is layoffs.  They seem to have more than normal.
Accenture,1ckaghb5h0mct1ft,2,Revolving door with constant churn of new employees,Subcontract Analyst,"Management doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about concerns and senior staff acts like they can get away with everything because they will never get fired. They try to get as much overtime out of you as they can and you have no life outside of work. They don\xe2\x80\x99t properly train people. Whenever something goes wrong, they blame it on the new employees because they consider them inexperienced because they don\xe2\x80\x99t know the \xe2\x80\x9cAccenture Way\xe2\x80\x9d There is no team environment, it\xe2\x80\x99s every man for themselves type of work environment. I would avoid this place like the plague."
Accenture,1ckaf0a921ah31jf,4,Decent Place to Work,Business Operations Specialist,Overall the company is good. Good benefits and culture. Lack of growth opportunities in the San Antonio locations. Not the case for other Accenture locations.
Accenture,1ck942on80kbs389,2,Constant stress and pressure to work overtime,Technology Analyst,I was placed on a contract several months ago and have noticed that recently my boss has been asking me to get my work done on a quicker timescale than normal so that I can be used on other projects as well. There is a real need to hire more people with tech skills and with the current shortage it has been hectic to say the least. I routinely do the work of 2 technology analysts and am expected to go above and beyond because we are struggle to retain our top talent. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to get burnt out quick here.
Accenture,1ck8btjbd1fdo5ar,3,External Contractor- Many questions does not apply,Sr. SAP PP/MM Consultant,"I was an external contractor, so lot of questions may not apply; I knew what I was doing so did not need lot of coaching;  Lot of time managers have no time to train, they are away in customer meetings; I can imagine how new recruits can be scrambling for directions in a new customer project. Managers have too little time to teach newbies. Best to find a mentor in the customer side, and offer to their boring work, in return for some coaching..."
Accenture,1ck7sig0k1d0r65j,5,"Contract work, unpredictable",Full Time / Permanent,"Although I enjoyed my position with Accenture which was Alcohol and Drug Control Officer for the MO Army National Guard, the contract issue was always looming.  It was re-evaluated each year.  The uncertainty of renewal was always stressful."
Accenture,1ck6gp4h21ahk1kb,1,Don’t work here,Accounts Payable Specialist,"This is not the same Accenture it used to be. Management is very poor and makes decisions and enacts policies that have no logic or common sense behind them. They do not hire when people leave and just expect everyone else to not see their families and pick up the slack. The management here really does not care about their employees one bit. No raises and they pay less than what the entry level for my career is. The buildings are old and not at all modern like other companies around San Antonio. The buildings are really disgusting to be honest, you would never think it's Accenture, but sadly it is."
Accenture,1ck3sab2k0mcm7ql,1,Build your resume and move on,Business Analyst,"Accenture has a severe problem keeping young talent around, and this will likely continue into the future. There's an old company culture with very conservative mindsets. I work in an IT group, and this company easily has the worst job culture compared to any anywhere else I've been. Examples: pay for your own coffee, no free lunches, business dress, expensive breakfast and lunches, and poor compensation. Three of the buildings I've worked in are little more than cube farms for entire floors, which tends to kill any chances employee collaboration and interaction.  Very rarely does an employee less than 28 stick around for more than 2 years."
Accenture,1ck3rngus1ai3456,1,Disappointed,Help Desk Analyst,"During my time at Accenture I was seriously disappointed with the culture this company promotes. Being a major US Government contractor with multiple locations, I was expecting a highly professional atmosphere with competitive compensation & benefits. What I was exposed to was a year of highly emotional management heavily pressuring employees to meet deadlines regardless of quality. It was not a pleasant experience at all. We were routinely asked to work upwards of 80 hours per week for little or no compensation. My co-workers would have been a great bunch of people to work with, if they weren't so stressed out all the time. The hardest part of the job was getting any time to spend with my family."
Accenture,1ck3r83i30mtm72a,2,Job was very different than what I applied for,Programmer Analyst,"The first day is a great picture that is painted for you , as your journey proceeds, you start to ask yourself what kind of koolaid did they give me, because the job culture is toxic and that's why theres big turnover. They claim it\xe2\x80\x99s attrition but the truth is they own you and if youre new they love hazing you and placing you on dull and dry projects. Worst toxic environment ever!"
Accenture,1ck3qd1uc1bg51c8,1,Expect to work 60 hours a week with no recognition,Billings Specialist,"Anyone with any common sense, ambition, motivation, or drive should STAY AWAY from Accenture Federal Services. Staying there too long will only lead to the decline of your self-respect, exhaustive (and unpaid) work hours, depression, stress, and eventual sessions with a therapist. My life constantly revolves around my job and I can\xe2\x80\x99t find time to focus on my personal goals and family. All my coworkers and myself feel burnt out and unappreciated with very little rewards and recognition to show for all our hard work."
Accenture,1ck3pteun0mt72hr,1,Nonexistent Management,Accounts Receivable Analyst,"Accenture Federal Services is a horrible place to work. Most new employees only stay only 1-5 years. Some new employees even leave before reaching their first year! Abysmal Attrition Rate - Accenture cannot keep new talent.\r The Management is poor and unfocused. Expect to be ""chewed-up"" by the Corporate Machine. Expect long hours! Most new hires have zero clout, and hence have poorer benefits, no real sick time (only a low amount of PTO), and no one to whom to voice their concerns. As noted, HR there does not help with complaints, and they only serve to make matters worse. HR is too tied up conducting exit interviews they can\xe2\x80\x99t focus on actual employees."
Accenture,1ck18nvpb1d034a4,3,Apply if you enjoy contract work,Loan Processor,I am 3 years into our contract and there have been no assurances that the contract with be renewed. I do not enjoy the nature of contract work. The stress of not having a job in the near future is difficult to manage.
Accenture,1ck141q5k0kbp1cv,1,Accenture was a total joke!,Project Manager,"This company is the old Andersen Consulting. It is a huge global company which sells its services to a company then slowly shifts its operations to India, Brazil, or some other country where wages are extremely low. This allows for maximum profit. The compensation and benefits are amazing, but you\'ll never have any free time to enjoy them. You will be expected to work 60 hours/week (probably on the road) and if you work really hard, you\'ll be given Accenture\'s greatest compliment, you\'ll be ""meeting expectations."" That rating comes with no annual increase, no bonus and no hope of advancement. The company likes to talk up their culture and uses terms like ""Team Building,"" ""Integrity,"" and ""Stewardship."" These are great as long as they don\'t stand in the way of the bottom line. In the last year of my employment, I worked 100-hour weeks, had no life whatsoever, was on-call 24/7. I was laid off when it was decided to move the day-to-day management of my account to someone in Bangalore, India."
Accenture,1ck13kukk1bg512m,1,Accenture Federal Services was the worst job ever,Capture Manager,This place is a dry low energy workplace with nothing going for it. Had to leave because the projects were boring and mundane. The office was very political and not healthy for single women.
Accenture,1ck13ce6j1agn271,1,Lack of management,Technology Analyst,This place is run by all the young analysts. Employee turnover is so high that they can\xe2\x80\x99t retain good managers and make them stay for more than a year. I found it hard to move up or get a pay raise due to lack of visibility and no management. No recognition for a good job and no leadership skills in current management.
Accenture,1cjuq579u1d140gc,4,Good spot to start a career,Orbit Analyst,Was good for starting to get trained in a field.  Lack of management was good and bad. Was hard to get a pay raise and they seemed surprised when I left.
Accenture,1cjupsr740mt765u,3,Great Culture Terrible Project Management,Test Engineering Senior Analyst,"The culture is very relaxed and friendly. Employees are given a lot of freedom. Unfortunately, the project management style is chaotic, inefficient and outdated. Employees end up working 60+ hours weeks for several weeks in a stretch due to poor resource management and over promising of delivery to the client."
Accenture,1cjuf4m0h0mcm3v2,1,Unprepared and untrained management,Web Designer,The turnover here is so high that they are forced to promote the people that weren\xe2\x80\x99t talented enough to get out and find another job in to top management positions. Major brain drain situation going on here and it\xe2\x80\x99s getting worse by the day. The most talented employees are finding better jobs leaving the low performers left behind.
Accenture,1cju230vl1d1464l,5,Great Work environment,Home Loans Process Analyst,I had been working at Bank of America home loans for 6 years when the bank gave me a offer to work for a contractor as they had to close down the loan center at the end of the building lease. Accenture provided a very employee friendly environment. I really liked everyone I worked with. Unfortunately due to lack of loans to process Accenture has been downsizing this business over the last few years.

Accenture,1cjtkeudp1ai32pe,2,No clarity or structure,Application Developer,Very ridgid chain of command with no clear org charts or job descriptions. There is a lack of communication from managers on project expectations and how people are reviewed for performance and promotions. I am one of the multiple people that have held my current role over the past year and there has never been a clear transition plan. No wonder why so many people find it hard to work here and leave because managers are so unclear on what they expect of you.
Accenture,1cjtk4c0i0mtm6fg,2,Male dominated workplace,FP&A Analyst,There are very few woman in technology/business leadership roles here. As a woman I have felt like Accenture is a male dominated company. I have always felt it hard to take off time for errands or emergencies for my children due to the lack of understanding with male managers.
Accenture,1cjtd91nb0kbp2ff,1,Accenture Federal Services,Systems Engineer,"This place is toxic, churn and burn all the new employees right out of college.

Accenture,1cjs7f2ce0mtm206,4,A typical work day,Software Developer Analyst,"A typical work day at Accenture varies according to your project. My typical work day is working on daily tasks and sometimes taking a break in the break room which includes a game table, television, kitchen and snack machines. It also has a decent view of a pond and geese.\r I've learned the history behind our project and the importance of our day to day task and how it all works. The hardest part is being inspired when you lack motivation but the enjoyable part is knowing this is only the beginning which motivates me to continue pushing."

Accenture,1cjlscbq452t6bve,1,Something is missing.,Contracts Manager,"My time at Accenture was very strange, I felt like there was something amiss at all times, maybe it was the toxic work culture or the fact that there was very little guidance from leadership.

Accenture,1cjfepbrgaqh3d9t,1,Accenture,Operations Manager,Accenture is a good company to work for... just never work for the Charlotte location on Forrest Point BLVD. The management staff is not adequate to run the office. Leadership in that location do not care about there employees however the other locations are not like this.

Accenture,1cjetjujp52t69si,2,No longer what it used to be.,Cyber Security Analyst,"Accenture is no longer what it used to be.

Accenture,1cja4p9a15j53d3t,2,No energy and dry atmosphere,Scrum Master,The work environment here is so dry and no energy with unmotivated coworkers.

Management just pushes deadlines and the entire company is clearly short staffed and just churning work out through all of the new hires and burning them out until they quit. No one stays here longer than 8 months. If you are looking for a long term career this is not the place for you."
Accenture,1cj7fm15gaqh2e9b,1,I regret accepting a job here right out of college!,Recruiter,"I was hired right out of college at campus recruiting event, I should have known that the offer was too good to be true. My coworkers are incompetent, and turnover is so high it\xe2\x80\x99s like a revolving door. Leadership needs to fix things soon."
Accenture,1cj7f7j5t5j53ftb,2,Absent Leadership,Salesforce Developer,I was staffed on a project right out of college when hired and 3 months went by before I met my career counselor or upper management. Left this disfunctional organization because I was not getting the feedback I wanted from my peers or supervisors.
Accenture,1cj6fbhspakh29lo,5,great Work environment,Human Resources Recruiting Analyst,One of the top companies to work very flexible and openminded supervisors and leadership. Lacks promotions incentives or benefits that can engage you to get a promotion or any other great incentive. They should focus more on knowledgeable personnel rather the ones on high school diplomas that pretend to run the company.
Accenture,1cj4u5o32ak51ddm,3,Decent organization,Procurement Operations Associate,"Work was is extensive but, very good work environment. The organization always has special events and some teams are like families. But, not very much room for improvement with professional growth in management."
Accenture,1cj2l59c35nd2cpn,1,Toxic culture and poorly managed,Business Operations Analyst,"Accenture has no human aspect what-so-ever. There is no work life balance. There is never availability to take a day off, no matter how far ahead you request it. The training is a joke for new joiners right out of college so nobody really knows what they are doing. Managers constantly call around and talk bad about other departments and blames other teams for their own mistakes.  Accenture has gone down hill fast."
Accenture,1cj28101eb818876,3,You are a number,Consultant,People tend to be great but there is no real concept of company. It's just people who loosely know each other through projects that are focused on delivering value to customers. The company is just too big and you will feel like a number - your career is in your hands so don't expect people to help out or do much for you.
Accenture,1civtr7iq5j4vbct,1,Overworked and Burntout,Billing Analyst,"I was recently hired at AFS and was thrown into the thick of things with zero training.  Deadlines have been unrealistic and there is never ending work, management expects you to work overtime everyday to get the job done.  There is lots of infighting between different groups within Accenture and this has created a toxic environment with heavy employee turnover. Stay away from Accenture Federal, the stress and worklife balance burns you out in under 6 months."
Accenture,1cisr9d5das12dap,4,Steady work,Office Manager/Trainer,The job was steady and changing as the flow of people in and out of the office changed based on the projects that were being worked on at the time. The management was what you would expect for a large global company.
Accenture,1ciq1km50akguf27,5,Something different every day,Executive Assistant,"My role in executive support was one of great importance, allowing the senior leaders to seamlessly communicate and interact with clients and team members. Opportunity for advancement was not readily available in the workplace area of the company, so I had to make the move to Global Recruiting in order to move up in terms of responsibility and income. Being given the privilege to work at home in my Global Recruiting role was a great gift in terms of work/life balance."
Accenture,1ciptdc1o52t1e3t,5,Great Company,System Developer Associate Manager,They help mold a career with training and leadership.  There are lots of people to connect with to help expand your network.  It is a big company so there is a lot to learn.
Accenture,1ciphs8on5n91fgr,3,Was an intern but felt unwelcome,Intern,I was an intern but was not doing anything I had gone to school for. My direct supervisor was nice enough but I was working with an employee who worked remotely and he lacked communication skills and it was hard to work with him.

Accenture,1cilqvm0gb88vf7o,3,Promotes meritocracy with poor leadership management,Oracle CCB - Software Engineer,"Accenture promotes meritocracy on the highest level which involves very bad politics and poor management from the leadership. Based on my personal experience, employees with lower or entry level / mid-position are often not given the chance or worse stolen; to climb the career ladder."
Accenture,1cillglt652srcs5,1,Accenture Federal Services,DevOps Engineer,"Too many hours required to satisfy the employer. Substandard equiptment, bad managers, and uncomfortable working conditions. No team events due to budget cuts and constant churn of new employees. Having to communicate with supervisors was extremely stressful with most managers getting upset when we are behind schedule. The best part of the job was going home every day."
Accenture,1cilkla6u5j4qehr,1,No respect shown to entry-level employees,Technical Support Specialist,As a hire right out of college I felt rushed into my current role and viewed purely as a resource that could be used. There has been zero formal training and no clear set goals set out by my manager. Most days I find myself lacking direction from management and then scolded for missing deadlines when I was informed of them just a few hours before the due date.
Accenture,1cikvkdtjbrcvb8v,4,Great place to work,Management Consultant,Great compensation and benefits and many advancement opportunities. Work/life balance can be very difficult for those wishing to be promoted. Long hour and extracurricular activities are necessary.

Accenture,1cigfbpjfak8ser0,1,Management is uninspired,Corporate Functions,Management is not interested in fostering a team atmosphere. The vast majority of our team has left in the past 6 months because management has continually failed to encourage teamwork. Management continually pits one group against another and shames groups in meetings. The work itself is stressful with now clarity or expectations set by management. \r-The environment is horrible
Accenture,1cigeeonrakgpf7t,1,Disorganized!,Proposal Writer,"This place is so disorganized! Way too much overtime, no work/life balance. Very top heavy with too many managers and not enough other support staff. This created a very stressful and fully loaded work schedule with demanding deadlines. Work force is tired and unfriendly. Turnover is insanely high and morale is bouncing off rock bottom."
Accenture,1ciaf2pna5ncscfn,1,"US Customs and Border Protection, eroding company values",Subcontract Administrator,Accenture Federal has recently taken on work with the US Customs and Border Protection agency to help recruit and hire new border patrol agents. This has dampened morale of immigrant employees and shows that the core culture and values of the company is changing. A large percentage of employees are  immigrants themself ans I feel like management is showing they don\xe2\x80\x99t care about workplace inclusion and diversity anymore.
Accenture,1cia8te0vakgpcmg,3,Seen Better Days,Marketing Manager,"I really liked Accenture in the beginning -- cool projects, awesome and smart people, work/life balance, etc. There was nothing bad to say about this place. As of late there have been many organizational changes and new leadership and high employee turnover in my department.  People are asked to do way to much, no career growth, and morale is LOW."

Accenture,1ci7scnusak8sdcp,2,Great job until you're laid off,CMS Developer,It was a good place to work with great benefits. But then the contract ended abruptly. That's when HR only paid lip service in helping you find work. I received very little guidance with no real concern about my future.
Accenture,1ci63nc7cakcnanj,3,No Comments,Associate Manager - SAP FICO,"Accenture pampers its freshers, junior resources and abuses its senior skilled members. Middle level Management works on favoritism rather than meritocracy, sincerity and output from the individuals."
Accenture,1ci61fo9t5j4nd4r,3,A Hard-working Career when time and effort is put forth,Test Engineering Associate Manager,"Accenture is a good company to start a career and learn many different skills. If you are in it for the money, Accenture is not the place to be. One will never be bored with their job and will wear many different hats. But their lies in the problem that sometimes what one wants to do they inadvertently learn and start doing what the project or lead/manager wants. Accenture always wants one to lead and manage. Unfortunately it\xe2\x80\x99s always up or out.  There is no path for an individual contributor.\r  Cons:\rprojects have their own culture, new vacation policy, hire too many fresh-out-of-college, consultants from accenture's commercial side lack the patience for their federal clients, federal projects are short term, provides below average salary increases and bonuses, promotions are not based on merit, work life balance varies depending on the project age demographics, networking events and team building are gear towards younger employees, short bench time, some projects lack diversity, no path for individual contributor"

Accenture,1chrmlbchakgjama,1,Management can’t seem to retain employees,Client Financial Management Specialist,I recently left Accenture Federal due to the incredible turnover in staff that made me realize I was underpaid.

That included managing production and quality service level agreements for the client.  I also worked directly with an offshore support team for our Charlotte office.  I produced reporting that would benefit in accuracy, proficiency and to reduce audit findings that would save in any compensatory fines.  \r Accenture's workplace culture encouraged all teams to be involved in many different Employee Resource Groups, volunteer in the community and serve as mentors.  \r The best part of my job was to have the support from upper management to make decisions, create better processes and share knowledge with other sectors of the company."

I have not seen my family in weeks due to the need to constantly be at the office. I leave before my kids are up, and get home well after they are in bed. No holidays, no vacation time, no opportunities for growth. I came into this role with more than the required skills. I feel as though those skills have degraded because I'm not allowed to use them. The other employees would rather use me as an excuse/liability to save themselves from doing any work. I get told that as a contractor I'm replaceable so I had better just toe the line for them. This is terrible and NOT worth the measly pay increase I got from my last admin role."

Accenture,1cfld22fb1ba11p3,4,Great Company with drawbacks,Senior Analyst,"While I love Accenture's culture and enjoyed working with most of the people I encountered, there are some clear drawbacks. Since it is client based work, the working environment you are exposed to is NOT Accenture's 90% of the time, it is the client you are working for. So while Accenture may be a fantastic company with a great culture, those working for the company have to endure being treated poorly by clients, being pushed into small conference rooms to work, etc. Additionally, their new joiner development program does not do enough to rotate their people to get their new joiners exposed to different industries and type of work. Often people get stuck in one industry or doing one type of work and find it hard to get out of that track."

Accenture,1ce9dpvm9b855a0f,4,Great place to develop skills and gain industry experience,Technology Consultant,"Accenture, like most large consulting firms is a great place to gain exposure into many other companies without having to actually work for any one of them. Accenture consults for a large majority of the fortune five hundred companies and with offices around the globe it is often possible to travel to other states or even abroad for work. This may not be the case for everyone, but it is definitely a possibility. The culture of Accenture is surprisingly collaborative and helpful, which you wouldn't typically expect with a consulting company of this size. There have been some changes recently with how the yearly evaluations are done, so I think this has helped shift the work environment in a more collaborative direction rather than being really cutthroat. Day-to-day work varies depending from role to role and even from week to week, but it is consulting after all. The last thing I would like to mention is that one of the best things about Accenture has been the people. From managers to peers, everyone seemed genuinely happy to help and open to share knowledge and experiences."

Accenture,1cbad3oj0ak4ke88,4,Best consulting company. Stayed too long.,Senior Manager,"Great people. Great thought capital, innovation. Challenging, interesting work. Super company to start with and get as much out of the experience as you can. Not a better consulting company out there.A bit political, and you need to know when to exit. Some can go all the way, but most will not and there are law of diminishing returns on your career. Also, there is a high price to pay in terms of demands, including but not limited to work effort, work hours, travel, etc. You can set boundaries, but realize there could be career limitations depending on how you are viewed by management."

Accenture,1cb6hpb93brcob31,3,"Competitive, a bit cut-throat, but interesting work and exposure",Business & Delivery Manager,"Although they sometimes let their new recruits, experienced or not, become sacrificial lambs for projects that are already in disarray with their less savoury clients, the advantage is you can get to work on lots of different projects and learn a lot on the fly as they switch you from project to project. They are flexible in terms of work arrangements, and they are also very good in terms of openness to telecommuting which is a huge plus for people with young families, but then again you have to be open to travel at all times if clients demand it, i.e. you can be working at home for a few days then flying in to one client then driving to another client site the week after, thus it might be a better job for someone who doesn\'t have a young family to take care of and look after. You might get put on projects that are a different module or technology than you are used to, which I find is great because you get to learn new technologies and re-use your existing soft skills and knowledge so that you are still valuable for the client. I also loved being exposed to IT related business strategy of large enterprises and SMEs in different markets. Also, if you quit before a year, they will send your information to collection agencies to get your signing bonuses back without even notifying you, a truly extreme version of the disingenuous business practice know as ""golden handcuffs."""

There are opportunities to drive your own career advancement.  The downside is that it is very easy to just be viewed as a resource and if you end up on bad assignments, it can be difficult to express that and move on to another roll.  I have met some of the most amazing people in working at Accenture.  The company is full of go-getters, which is a positive if you like to learn from others, but can leave some feeling overwhelmed.  There is also the possibility that you end up working under someone that doesn't have good personal values.  Once you're on a project, you don't want to feel like you are complaining, but there are project leaders who don't treat people equally."

I still have hope and would like to be positive about it. It's a bit difficult though, because I come from an onshore culture and not an offshore culture, like 90 percent of the people I work with. The offshore way of doing things in IT just does not cut it for me. Or at least it has not cut it for me at my current client and believe me I've tried to do it their way. If you land a job with a client that has a large learning curve, watch out. No one will help you and management will expect you to figure things out by reading 20 page documents and building your own contacts within a 60-100 person team. If you are a new person coming in, there is no structure for you to get up to speed ,even if you stay patiently for a year and work hard. Need I say more? \r I can't speak for other clients.

Chances to step up and lead even as a lower level employee. The work here is both challenging and engaging.\r Cons: The pay for the work you put in is well below the industry standard. I understood this when I took the job. Comparable jobs with other companies are often 20-40k more.\rThe performance reviews are frustrating. You are given a career counselor who represents you during a phone call. You are not able to participate in these calls or defend yourself. In my case, I was given a career counselor who, during the performance review time, was leaving the company and we only spoke once before this. This is a pretty big flaw to me."

Accenture,1c901opsu1ah90ka,4,Must Be This Type A to Continue Riding This Ride,Business & Systems Integration Consultant,"There is no typical work day at Accenture unless you are in an internal position or staff augmentation role. Your experience is very client and role dependent, and I seemed to keep drawing short straws in several of my clients and roles.\r Expectations are high of all consultants and above to be constantly learning and meeting or exceeding all explicit or unspoken expectations. There is good training available internally, but you must seek it out and jump through a few approval hoops to get the client time off for classroom training.\r Your client and Accenture management are also very client dependent, and this part of the job can feel very soul-sucking at times. You will be expected to booze and schmooze frequently if you want to be considered enough of a team player to be promoted.\r The workplace culture tries its best to seem fairly relaxed and egalitarian, but promotion cycles and evaluation processes were changed at least 3 times (about once every 2 years) in my time there with little explanation or concrete details on the ""meritocracy"".\r The hardest part of the job were the long days of mind-numbing meetings and endless tasks to do with little thought to prioritization or deadlines given. As I\'ve mentioned before, this is heavily client dependent, but it\'s hard to believe that it\'s gotten better. If Accenture or other consultants are needed, then someone typically screwed up royally or clients are trying to implement something beyond the scope of their current workforce\'s capabilities.\r The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely the unique and ever changing"
Accenture,1c8viq16sakfkcsb,4,Good work environment,Data Management - Sr. Analyst,Jobs can very greatly from area to area.  It's contractual work with  clients of Accenture.

Along the way, I learned a lot about the management side of IT, and how that's where the real work is.  \r If you join Accenture, you are expected to manage your career.  You will get help, but you have to drive it yourself.  You'll be expected to choose, eventually, if you want to stay technical or be a manager. Make sure you understand the risks and benefits of both sides, and how it fits into your life.  \r Consultants travel 100% of the time. Don't do it if it's not for you."

Accenture,1c8j5pfvcakfhe6n,5,Team Placement is Accurate,Program/Project Manager,Everyone here is great at their job so it is very competitive to move from one project/client to another. You are responsible for your career movement and if a project ends with a client you are responsible for finding another client or placement or you have no job. It is a lot like contract work unless you work for the several corporate offices across the US and globe. Great long time contracts with amazing clients and moving around helps you not get stagnant and meeting new people every few years which is always fun and keeps you lively and learning new skills. Takes a long time to get through any interview process here no matter for your 1st job placement or your 10th.

Accenture,1c8a2kev7akjc9q5,4,Goldmine if you're in the right place,Application Development Specialist,Working at Accenture is entirely about being at the right place at the right time. If you land yourself a good role under a good manager and for a good client then you'd never want to move out or find a better pasture to graze. Everything eventually goes down to your boss and if you are on good terms with him/her since that's the only person responsible to seal your fate.

Accenture,1c85v5hvm1d091ge,2,Project to Bench competitive culture,Infrastructure Services Data Center Team Lead,"New employees are placed on the ""bench"" until a project comes available.  If the sales team does not get a sign off on a project and Accenture overhires, you get stuck waiting to be placed.  That process can last for over 4 weeks.  You get paid but you have to constantly churn through any available projects to try to get ""placed"".  The staff that places you uses key words in your resume to get you onboarded and often messes up.  Usually, out of college, new hires will get many of the positions that are lower level analyst types.  These folks are fighting to get to consultant level and step all over anyone in their path to get there.  Seasoned IT people always need to shmooze up to whoever they can ""network"" with.  IMHO -- terrible business model but they seem to think it\'s the best they can provide their 380000 person workforce."

I have learned to work collaboratively with client and peer support teams to develop solutions to solve these challenges.  Having a supportive management team and creative license aided in the process.  The hardest part of the job involves working with client staff who feel threatened and not as welcoming to the idea of trying new approaches to solve problems.  I most enjoyed the people I have had a pleasure to work with around the globe.  They are very smart, supportive, and challenge you to do you best daily."
Accenture,1c7ej8iclakf5aqh,4,Working at Accenture.,Software Tester Engineering,"Accenture is an excellent place to work. Because this place opens up many opportunities for those, who are interested in working in the IT field. Your work to life is balanced out pretty well also the company pays their employees pretty well too, and the benefits here are excellent also, you get to travel. \r Now there is some downside to the company, and the first one is that you have to be careful who you talk to because people talk. \r Second, the work here is very demanding and not for people who want to be lazy also; it can get very stressful too. \r Third, job security is not the best here sometime due to the lack of work around the office can put your job in jeopardy.\r So, with all that said I recommend that you should still apply to work here because like I said earlier in the review this place opens up many opportunities for the future."

Accenture,1c71pdh3hakj1cio,4,"Fast-paced, room for growth, mixed opportunities available",Software Engineer Analyst,"I am currently in a Dev Ops role, so sometimes the day can get really busy if I have to migrate over a lot of items. Since the Continuous Integration piece is not fully automated yet, there are quite a few things that are migrated manually, and thus, depending on the number of environments, this can get tedious. Also, for some environments, since I should not be modifying anything during business hours as users are utilizing the environment, the job also entails working late at night to update some components.\r I have learned a lot while working at Accenture and have been in various roles in the SDLC from developer to production support. Accenture is good for people who do not mind working in different roles as project needs dictate and are flexible in travelling to other locations on a weekly or bi-monthly basis. The number of opportunities are variable depending on project availability in your home location, so travel or relocation is required for some roles.\r The work experience is highly variable depending on the team you work with and the management. In some projects, things have flowed very smoothly where the team communicates with each other well and management explains the requirements succinctly and clearly. In other projects, things have fallen apart due to conflicts in priority from various managers, and the team members fail to communicate properly with each other.\r The best part of working at Accenture is the people. Typically, you can reach out to leadership/managing directors directly, and most people are willing to help out when they can, sharing knowledge"

In order to complete all of you work you would need to sit at your desk for 9 hours straight with no breaks. And there would still be more work to do. Although you do not have the underwriter title you are in fact an underwriter. Hence why the company pays processors so much money. \r Company culture is great, many parties and events. The company makes you feel valued although not all managers share the same sentiment. \r The benefits are wonderful.

Accenture,1c6392p9cakei816,1,Lack of Investment in Employee Development and Retention,Consultant,"Accenture's primary goal is to make money and please shareholders, which often comes at the direct expense of it's employees. Hours are long, work is often unorganized, and there is little to no investment in the career development of employees.\r Leadership functions in a black-box and makes little effort to be transparent with employees. Career progression and compensation are said to be based on performance and merit, but this is not true in practice. Tenure is the main determining factor of promotion and compensation increases, which leads to many frustrated employees. Performance matters little to none.\r Offers provided by Accenture can be misleading and almost deceitful. Bonuses in offer letters are provided as a range, and I have not heard of one individual obtaining a year-end bonus anywhere near the maximum of that range. Bonuses are not a noteworthy potion of compensation, and compensation lags behind peers and competitors.\r You will gain a plethora of experiences while working for Accenture, but this is due to the unreasonably long hours and absurd expectations, which force you to go above and beyond to meet deadlines and deliverables. This is not a product of the work or projects Accenture completes within the strategy space."

I always said this is a perfect place for college students and immigrants with tech backgrounds to start out. I couldnt imagine putting in 40 years here, though. It is just so massively stressful and overloaded. The resources are amazing, though. You can  literally learn anything for free.

Accenture,1c5oim8i9aqiads0,4,Excellent Career Launchpad,Digital Strategy Manager,"Accenture is a great place to learn and grow in your career. The resources, pay and benefits are great and so are most of the people. Most consultants get to perform a variety of roles at client accounts across different industries, exposing them to a large network of people and a wealth of experience. Sometimes you get stuck working long hours, but if you're on the road, that is acceptable and expected. After several years many people start to get road-weary and want more of a work-life balance. While this is possible for some, it is difficult to consistently find local work."

Interviewing may be tough and ambiguous, but once in you will be on the bench. You will be responsible for driving your own training and career and there is always help. Accenture is a meritocracy and you will get out of it what you put into it. Developers, this is your world, you will do what you want and always be in demand. Non-Technical, you will need to shine in your analysis, presentation and influence skills.\r I have gone around the world with Accenture, had a chance to challenge and change the way companies think. I worked hard for a promotion and enjoyed a chance to mentor a young team. I came into the company as an experienced Manager with a BA. When I showed my voice, I grew and worked into the roles I really wanted.\r You will be exposed to leading technologies and grow your resume. You can spend 3  years there and have a respectable background, or work into Manager where the money begins.

What I can say is know what you are doing before you get hired. The training the company offers is horrible and it will not set you up for success.

Your success or lack there of is very dependent on the group and the management support you have, assuming of course you  are a high performer and with over 400,000 employees globally, coming in as a new hire, you don\'t know what the work environment and politics are in your onboarding group until you\'ve been there for a while.  You can only hope you end up in a well managed group.\r There are definitely ""favorites"" and fast trackers and if you don\'t fall into these categories  but are a high performer you will do OK but not see the advancement you want.   Definitely not an environment in which you can ""skate"".\r I\'ve seen many cases where those in favor are promoted to roles where they succeed only because they manage up, working for/with them is a nightmare.\r Having said that, the work is interesting and if you can find a niche for yourself and continually produce great results you can learn a lot and be professionally fulfilled."

Not exactly a tech company, although they have plenty of projects related to tech. In my experience, being the most productive in terms of lines of code written, reviewed, features implemented, bugs fixed, etc. will not move you up faster than alliances with middle management, who will not bring up stats that git logs lines of code committed, and that Confluence tracks hours spent on tasks. Spent a good year and a half to two years here only to find out they aren't really a tech company, but just another consulting group."

The environment is very slow and inconsistent - internal changes are made without notification making everyone's job more stressful and unproductive. The turnover rate is enormous - every month 6 or seven people leave in a given department and are not quickly replaced.

One of the only companies I know of that offers 4 months of paid maternity leave .... yes that right for direct hire employees....Four months paid maternity leave...that in its self is hard to beat.

Definitely loved the responsibility, the way you can be a sponge and learn new things, but if you are in technology, remember that technology gets old fast...so that can always be a struggle.

Accenture,1c0u2sji15na094v,4,Federal: great work life balance but limited mobility,Technology Consultant,"Pros\r Most people here on the federal side are great, supportive, honest, and professional. I've met quite a few who are really bright and impressive. Company values align pretty closely to mine and feels less corporate than other consulting companies. My managers have been very good about letting me take time off, as well as work remotely. Work life balance, at least on the federal side, has been great.\r Cons\r The work on the federal side is not very exciting. Your clients will be risk-averse and the solutions implemented reflect that. Sometimes feels like staff aug and not really consulting. Although AFS likes to think that they're forward-thinking, they really aren't in practice. They are also very risk-averse and shy away from innovative solutions. Many of the people I've encountered are only smart enough and don't really exhibit much intellectual curiosity or creativity. To be fair, Accenture does little to promote this. They're a bit stingy with their training budget and rarely invest in meaningful and/or prudent ways to make the most of their employees.\r Advice to Management\r Make it easier for your employees to get skills and work in areas that your company is looking to grow in. If you claim that AI or IoT is the future, then encourage your employees to take training in that space, not SAP. Find work for your company in new areas, not just the same soon-to-be legacy solution."

Accenture,1bvvpbnijakd698g,3,Okay as a stepping stone,Analyst,"The management is very poor. You are told one thing but they deliver another. The only reason a lot of people stay is because of the benefits. It is very stressful and while they are lots of positions open, majority of them are very project specific, wanting someone who is currently on that team or managerial level. Also, managers love to block promotions and you transferring off of the projects."

The team and particular assignments were stressful, since there were several company overlays in management and client organizations.

I learned a lot about client interactions and was able to learn new skills and build upon skills I already had, such as writing, research and presentation. Unfortunately my team lead traveled to our client site, so I did not get to interact with them as much as I would have liked. There often felt like a disconnect between employees and leadership, and employees frequently talked about feeling unappreciated at our work site. Overall, it was a mixed experience with many challenges and positive learning/growing experiences."

Working with them was a wonderful experience. However, working with my direct boss was not.  When someone would prefer you to be a part of a click who did nothing but socialize after work and because you chose not to conform with this standard practiced, your work was scrutinized and you were eventually let go, that becomes a major concern."

Constantly changing the standard operating procedure(twice a month) Will only be promoted based off of popularity not results.

Accenture,1btsieifhb80mfaa,5,Great Place to work,Mortgage Loan Processor,Very hands on and through training. Cares about employees success. Challenging work environment but open to new ideas.

Accenture,1btsdioo1ak91ars,4,Good Company Overall,Enterprise Application Integration Lead,"Your Accenture experience is dependent upon your project and manager.   Great company for your first job.  On cutting edge of new technologies.  Benefits are good, but have gotten more costly over the years."
Accenture,1bts7sm6c5nfca1d,1,Not a Good Fit,Manager,"This company is ideal for young professionals who have made career advancement a top priority. For those with families and other responsibilities outside of work, it is not ideal. The hours and travel associated with any type of long-term position require sacrifice. If one is not willing to sacrifice, they are black-listed and pushed out. To a new employee, a better salary and increased time off looks appealing, but the hours demanded reduce the hourly wage well below acceptable norms, and many employees (non-management) are denied time off."
Accenture,1bts6ctagak918bk,1,Career suicide.,Unix & Linux Systems Administrator,"You are overworked to the most extent of the word.\r If you are thin skinned to racism, not the place for you.\r Overtime is highly restricted.\r If you are just out of college and want to cut your teeth on working in the engineering world then I would say this is the company to do it, but only for a year maybe a year and a half."

Accenture,1btmqnrqjak8rbd8,4,Good company if you want to travel and never be home,Mortgage Loan Processor,"It was like working for temp agency, but paid during the down time, however, if they lay you off u only get 2wks of pay. The recruiter nor company never explained how the business works. They are contracted with many companies who can drop them at anytime which means they can drop you. A lot of positions require a lot of travel. Great for ayoung person or single person. Constantly lookiing for the next opportunity as if you are unemployed"
Accenture,1btmp445o5nb9eqn,1,Everyone out for themselves,Management Consulting,"The fact that you have to apply to assignments makes the culture very ""old boys club."" They hire people with specific skill sets, and then don\'t place them on work that utilizes those skill sets because someone else, without those skills but happened to know the senior manager got it. You end up with projects run by people who don\'t know what they are doing, and people who do know what they are doing leaving quickly. I have not been on a project yet where everyone you\'re working with is just trying to leave. Coming from the client side, I can 100% see why there is massive mistrust of management consulting. The work product is poor."
Accenture,1btlb8qmkak4pdj6,5,productive and fun working place,Senior Software Engineer,It is a very productive and fun working place.I love this place and would recommend people working here.This place in jersey city is too  cool.i would recommend everyone to work here

An exciting place to work if you crave variety and would like the opportunity to learn many roles and grow in business acumen."
Accenture,1btcki1qcakgo842,4,Great Company,Pricing Specialist,Overall experience will depend dramatically based upon your role within the company.  Corporate functions offer very little room for upward mobility.  Advancements typically are dependent upon others vacating their roles.
Accenture,1btcda47iak8pe7v,2,Accenture was an eye-opener,Business and Technology Delivery Specialist,"At first I was very excited to be hired by Accenture, as it is a big name company with a lot of good press. However, once there, it was nothing what I was expecting.\r I was hired to work on SAP products, with their full knowledge that I only had Oracle experience at that point. Between the time of my hire and my start, the company reorganized, so I was added to a new team. Instead of being placed on assignments, you have to basically apply and compete against your teammates, which I did not find helpful. You spend all your time trying to get picked up on rolls instead of actually working and getting things done."
Accenture,1btb3qaukbrfk99b,3,Good Place If You Can Handle The Lifestyle,Supply Chain Management Consultant,"Lots of great people that work at Accenture doing a lot of amazing things.

There are very few people I have worked with at Accenture that I have not enjoyed working with. The main downside is the annual review process which no one really takes seriously, criteria for advancement are unclear, and results are not communicated until 4-5 months later (literally, round tables finish in July, and you don't hear back until December. Most other places I worked at have had a 2 week turn-around tops)"
Accenture,1bta3p02m52v5fiu,4,Be ready to work,Delivery Lead and Program Manager,This is a great place to start when you are first out of college. The work life balance is tough unless you are single and enjoy to travel. Great exposure to executives early in your career is a plus.

Accenture,1bt921l49ak8m8ql,1,Terrible Management,Senior Manager,"Management within the Marketing and Communications dept is completely incompetent. They were never able to communicate their business objectives and what they needed from the various teams to be successful. In other words, people worked very long hours to only  guess on what should be delivered. ""Leadership"" points fingers, blames and will throw their employees under the bus to save their own skin. Accenture is a great company in other areas. However, Marketing and Communications is a complete disaster. Caveat Emptor!"

I have no complaint about compensation, as I felt my pay was fair.\r My big complaint is with recent changes.  The company is returning to the Move Up or Move Out model which was used back in the old days.   If you don't advance to the next level of promotion in a certain time frame, you are asked to find a new job (either elsewhere within Accenture or outside).   \r As more experienced individuals are forced out of the firm, the workforce will become more youthful.  While this sounds like a good thing, there are certain advantages with trust when it comes to having grey hair.   All of the executives at Accenture will eventually be under 40 years old.   Sounds great, except I am not sure if most of them will be listened to."

I feel like working for Latam I have gained different insights to help me go further in terms of completing my job, working under stress and with time constraints but losing sights of this being customer service career and always being able to provide the customer a smile even under stressful situations.  The hardest part of the job for me is sometimes being overwhelm by the amount of work and not being able to help everyone at the same time but instead having to prioritize, but it still feels great when at the end of the day you manage to achieve everything you set up to do at first.

The idea was good but the plan was over ambitious and poorly implemented. We had management that did not understand the mortgage process, and management from Bank of America that would not accept the Accenture culture. They hired unskilled new employees and failed to properly train them. The division went downhill due to contract mismanagement and moral sloped greatly and quickly. I was included in the second round of layoffs, which took places in groups of 40-50. This was not due to production, as my team was constantly in the top percentile, but due to my salary."

If you want to have some work-life balance, this is not.

Inducing stress is used to ""motivate"" or eliminate team members. \r If you will depend on your position to support a family, set aside money for an employment law attorney.

Accenture,1bonp8q30b81idgv,3,All about the numbers,Fulfillment Team Leader,This company talks about caring for their associates. It is absolutely not true. They are all about the bottom line and have no loyalty to their associates at all. They make snap decisions without proper vetting. They are also too global - most employee relations are handled in other countries by people who do not know anything about the culture in the US and often are difficult to even understand. I found their HR to be very poor.

As a junior analyst with the least amount of experience on my team, I had to take meeting minutes for every meetings and it was stressful, especially if everyone speaks extremely fast and you want to make sure you don't miss anything important. BUT, I learned a lot about the client and the business processes of how everything runs. There are tons of knowledgeable people you can learn from and job culture is awesome. The worst part is that AFS is a contractor and your job is not always secure. In my case, the client took away 50% of the funds and they had to roll off/let go 60 people within the project including myself. Now I'm on the bench/still getting paid....need to find a new project within 1 month or I'm canned. Just the nature of the business. Time to find a different project!"

Accenture,1bmvdmhg15n92d3r,2,Don't Work Here,Consulting Analyst,"A typical day at work consists of being given contradicting tasks by several senior managers who fight amongst each other like children, then once you complete a task, you\'ll be told it was unnecessary.  You will not have any free time once you are on a client, and even though the corporate policy is to report every hour you work, when you work 70 hours a week you\'ll be instructed to report 40 so you don\'t actually get any overtime... They\'ll ""compensate you later.""  There is no promotion here, and even if you have decades of experience, you\'ll be brought in as an inexperienced hire.  Management at some levels appears to be helpful, but the general culture is toxic.  The most difficult part of the job is working with people who simply can\'t decide what they\'re doing from one minute to the next, and dealing with clients that just don\'t care whether or not they succeed as long as they can fight you the entire process.  I don\'t enjoy any part of this job."

There are a lot of events and opportunities to get to know coworkers, but there is no job security. I can\'t speak much about actual work because I was hired and trained for a position that wasn\'t even available. They hired people to put on the ""bench"" for when something did become available, but I was employed for a year and only had actual work to do for maybe 3 months. I continued looking for open positions, but they kept losing contracts with big clients and laying a lot of people off. I had just graduated college when I got hired and never really gained any experience because I was on the ""bench"" the whole time, so now I have been laid off and I\'m searching for a new job all over again with no experience. I\'m not trying to speak negatively of the company because I was laid off. I would actually love to continue working there if they had any jobs available and more job security because it\'s a really great company."

Regardless, most trainings, certifications, CoP's, etc. are designed by industry leaders at Accenture, so they are top-notch learning opportunities. \r The only downside is the work/life balance. Accenture takes great strides to provide help/support towards WLB and provides many extracurricular outlets for employees to enjoy themselves.

The culture had its challenges but we had several good EAs on my team and we supported each other to succeed.

We were encouraged to speed through the process, because management would make promises to the client that were almost impossible to keep, so a lot of claims weren't being done correctly. We had to constantly fix other people's mistakes, instead of the claim going back to the original claims adjuster.

They give you approximately 6 weeks of training before placing you on a platform (work area specific to your BPO contract and then by team or pod), then you have approximately 2-3 months to meet goals depending on your tenure.  Even though they may offer unlimited overtime, you had better produce because if the cost per unit (your paycheck versus what you produced) is above a certain $$$, you are given a warning.

Their commitment to workplace diversity is unmatched. Most of the people who work there are Contract workers, only one in five are actually employed by the company. Projects come and go there, giving opportunities for a change of pace and growth of experience, but contractors are laid off first between projects. I worked there for 2.5 years on two projects and the managers and supervisors are GREAT! They really are helpful and supportive of your growth and advancement (whenever possible). The pay is good, but there are no raises unless you convert to employee and advance. The only people they convert to employee are people on a Leadership track. Workers who are negative, mean-spirited, or bigoted either are not hired or they don't last long. Even with its negatives, I would go back to work there in a heartbeat."

I loved all the people I worked with.  I liked the fact all my Mangers were never micro managers.  They let you do your job because they knew you knew your position. We were always having some kind of celebration.  The first Tuesday of every month that is name tag Tuesday.  We had times where you could go to break room and dance, had gust speakers come in for Womens Week.  There was always sometime going on.  There is nothing nothing  hard about the job.  I had a great work schedule.  Worked 7am-4pm."
Accenture,1bfpedi105n8hchs,3,"Overall great company, but downsides",Analyst,"Overall Accenture is a fantastic company - great corporate culture, great benefits, room for growth, etc. The people are great too. However, job security depends entirely on contracts, which fluctuate with the industry. Transparency from management is lacking, and jobs seem to be taken offshore more and more every day. Interested to see where this company goes in the near future."

Accenture,1bfleagecaqghfk3,4,Very hard to advance,Assist client,"I worked extremely hard in this company and became one of the best people in my department. I received countless praise for my work and dedication from my management team. We were working to become full-time employees with the company itself and receive company benefits. However, they were only accepting a select number of people at a time, and there were often freezes on the hiring of those employees for several months at a time. When applying for a promotion, I was overlooked, and someone who was a friend of the department supervisor was promoted instead. While I hold no hatred for this incident, it did leave a sour taste in my mouth due to being unjustly disqualified from the position. I will say though despite all this my experience with the company was a very enjoyable one and one that I would gladly return to if needed."

Accenture,1bf107pbv0mco4vp,4,Great experience with solid colleagues and work environment,Marketing Manager,"Accenture is like a Vulcan from Star Trek: logical and emotionless. Employees are expendable, but taken care of until they're disposed of. That said, routine surveying of your chosen career path can help extend your lifespan; figure out where and how the company's trending, then try to take advantage of the opportunities (training, other roles) to build your skills in that direction. The diversity of work--and colleagues--should keep you occupied for quite a while, and I can honestly say that, even though some were misguided, everyone I worked with was willing to give 110%."
Accenture,1bf0hqrrfak4lcan,4,Not an employee friendly company,Software Engineer,"The learning path is very slow, what you get to learn here in 3 years is equivalent to what you learn in 1 year as per market standard.

I was TOLD not to accept this job and like a dumba I did  smh. Don't make the same mistake I did. DISCLAIMER: Management is soooo bad that I was instant messaged by multiple employees telling me how miserable that place is during my first legitimate week of work. The company is downsizing which is another red flag for ya. You will be required to clock your EVERY MINUTE! Management only hire their friends, yes this is true. Do not allow them to lie about advancement opportunities because they will. Management SO CAL Medicare only choose to engage with staff when their was a problem. QA's SO CAL DEPT. never offered to help until they realized it was backfiring on them. Seriously, I can't make this stuff up. This place is a hole for arrogance and ignorance."
Accenture,1belvb37d1ba94h3,4,Great Company to have on your resume but management needs improvement,Software Implementation Technology Consultant,"Accenture offers great benefits, great brand recognition, great projects to work on.  Downfall to Accenture are the incompetent management teams.  Management is only concerned about their well being and their own growth and prosperity.  They do not want you to grow or take the credit for items you've contributed on.  Its hard to move up internally to gain promotions, raises or level increase."

Accenture,1be6iotrg1ai3445,4,Great place to begin but know your exit point,Management Consultant,"Great place to start a career, however, it is very easy to get stuck in a role you are not interested in. At the lower levels (analyst through consultant) your interests aren't strongly considered. You are expected to have a high turnover and the company doesn't really start to care about you until you are a manager.\r Pay is decent but fighting for individual pay bumps based on individual circumstances (merit, location, client requirements) is bureaucratic at best."

People never seem to earn enough, or someone is always selling his latest gadget to upgrade to a more recent one. Someone always owes another something, or someone wants to join a different project.  Coming from the banking industry, I always seem to have a different opinion about these things.  I don't recall ever having talent discussions with my manager before; don't recall ever being asked to take strength finder tests to determine skill alignment. Accenture posters all over the work place scream talent development, training and values formation; employees tend to take these for granted. Only recently, Accenture has started a revolutionary idea which is quite bold and simple at the same time. In the past, Accenture employs individuals regardless of educational or work background ,subjects them to specific trainings to allow them to develop a particular skill they may lack. Today, Accenture subjects individuals to tests to determine their dominant trait, quality and skill. A report is generated to match the skill with a role. Not everyone is ready of course. Managers cling to the old traditions. Revolutions can be tricky and bloody but I dare say it is a very exciting time for Accenture."

Accenture,1b6a2d2mhak95cml,4,Good place to start a career,Consultant,"Accenture was great right out of college. I was on projects that I would travel weekly to. At the time I was single and didn't mind the travel. Yes, there were some late nights working and I was never home, but that allowed me to get perks both professionally and through miles/rewards that I wouldn't have gotten in another job. It was a great place to start since you're working with mostly young people in a similar situation to you. You also get to change projects to broaden your experiences, both in clients and roles. It's also a great place to start building a network."

Accenture,1b456bpppak5f9em,3,Excellence and hard work expected and rewarded,ETL DEVELOPMENT and SUPPORT PROGRAMMER/ANALYST,"Accenture's consulting model is to engage an organization and fix what's not working efficiently with their IT departments.  Over time, they sell themselves as being able to improve process efficiencies lower operational costs.  As time goes by, the point is to lessen the need for the client to utilize the company's services.\r For that reason, Accenture is a great place to work if you are innovative and multi-skilled, AND if you don't mind that your task is to make yourself obsolete at your present client.  If you don't mind moving on from client to client as a kind of gunslinger for hire, Accenture is a great place to be.\r Not so much if you are into building job security by doing one job well and building equity within an organization."

Accenture,1b3nrb9pn52tj91m,2,Unprofessional work environment,Claims Adjuster,"Job work/ life balance is hard to maintain. They pull you in with promises of overtime and advancements but overtime becomes less and less optional and advancements harder and harder to obtain. You wind up working more hours than is healthy and feel like you get nothing for it. Becoming a full time employee or ""FTE"" as they call it is nearly impossible unless you are in with the right people. Which means your job security is nonexistent.  Management positions are handed out the same way, most of the leads have no idea how to even work on the project they oversee. There is no leadership you can turn to if you have a problem with your lead because of the completely unprofessional work environment. The overall environment is more like a high school with constant drama. The co-workers were not trustworthy individuals at all! Lunches were stolen from break room refrigerators daily as well as items from desks! If you ask any of the employees ""lucky"" enough to be FTE they will sing Accenture\'s praises because they get a number of benefits that the other employees aren\'t afforded. Ask anyone who is not- they will share most of the same opinions as myself.  I would not recommend applying for jobs with this company, at least not at this location."
Accenture,1b3ice3h4as3a932,3,Accenture,Web Developer and Graphic Designer,Co workers for the most part were nice to work with. No job advancement or opportunities. Very much a 'young' company. They like to bring on college grads and burn them out as quickly as they can.

Accenture,1aos61aceak9lbbp,2,Great pay and benefits but feeling of job insecurity,Consultant/Manager,"Accenture is a great place to work for service/tech oriented people. The pitfall is, the service you provide may be temporary, even for an FTE. The services provided by the company I worked for was taken over by Accenture. Then the work was farmed to another Accenture location. Once we taught them our knowledge, we were left with... either find another opportunity within Accenture (which there were none at the location where I worked) or relocate IF you were able to find something at another Accenture center.  It seems as if we had to apply and interview for different positions within as if we were applying to different companies. This leaves a very insecure feeling, not to mention the chore of applying and interviewing every time the project ends. \rAlso, there were social agendas, and personal beliefs of others being thrown at us, rather than being just a professional place of business which kept to ""business"".  I believe they can leave all that social garbage out of the workplace and let\'s just ""work"".  We get enough of that on social media."

The culture is very much geared toward Accenture born-and-raised managers and young consultant employees who are required to travel a lot.  It is getting better regarding experienced hires, but the process has been slow. On one hand, there is a high commitment to quality, but on the other hand there is also sometimes a ""look the other way"" approach by management when quality issues are raised, especially when we have a tight schedule.\r They do strongly support community involvement and volunteering, and they try to have periodic team fun or charity fund raising events."

I have been there since they purchased the company I worked for almost five years ago.  The healthcare benefits are some of the best you will find, and the work load is enough to keep the overtime hours coming.  However, there is very little room for advancement, as the term Senior Analyst only goes to those who actually are performing a supervisor/management role, and then team lead goes to the actual manager of the team.  There will be one manager for a whole department.  This is not the way it should be, as senior analyst should be given to people that have been there for a certain time, such as three years and have a proven track record.  Team leads should then be a supervisor and manager should be the person managing the team.  This would open up a lot more advancement (well short term but why do that when you can keep paying people less than $20/hour."

My co-workers contributed a lot of developments in my career given we all have different personalities and yet able to come up to work as a team to be collaborative, patient, understanding and trustworthy in spite of all the challenges.

Accenture,1acpdss36ak7sd0m,3,Great Company Overall,Analyst/Sr. Executive Assistant,"There is no growth. If you are interested in another position you have to apply like everyone else does and compete with those outside of the company. There is no seniority.  If you are looking for growth within a company you can look elsewhere because they do not have it. Management is not the best. My colleagues were wonderful! The best set of hardworking, accommodating, and down to earth people. They make you want to be a better person.  The best part of the job was being able to get your hands in a lot of different projects and to see the success at the end made it all worthwhile."

Accenture,1abt51efv52v586c,1,complete opposite of work/ life balance,Mortgage Loan Processor,"This is a review of the Charlotte location ONLY. \rHere\'s  a company that over promises and under delivers.  The goals as a vendor were 2-2.5x what the clients expectations were, which were almost completely unattainable without putting in significant overtime.  If quality of your work matters, this is NOT the place for you.  Those who do the most production are rewarded despite the quality of the work.  Despite the man hours of reworking loans and mending customer relations due to closing date changes/ amounts.\r  Do not expect that you will be mentored into a position of your choosing.  You are merely a plug in a dam.  They put you where they need you, regardless of your career goals.  You will seldom ever receive a proper review.  Attrition is quite high for a company who boasts of a such a great culture.  \r The best part about this company is their benefits.  They are terrific.  Which is helpful given how many people go on short term for stress.  Which more often than not ended in Accenture severing ties after a few months of the person returning to work.  \r All in All, it was a waste of several years of my life.  You will not be able to navigate your career, this is simply a ""job"".  If you have no pride in your work and you\'re in it to milk some OT, this IS your place."

My management are all very skilled people -- Sales are a priority in this kind of company, so those skills are valued most.\r The challenges I faced were making sure the client was happy, and being intermediaries for our offshore developers.  The client you get is going to be out of your control.  They may like you or not, but you just have to do the best you can.\r I can't say positive things about the offshore people -- they seem to be hired according to a budget over their own skills.

Within days of being hired I was on a plane to a training facility and learning new skills that would be invaluable to my professional career for years to come. The support didn't stop there, with internal services in place to help employees find positions and roles available that would best suit them.\r The work I did changed from role to role but it was always a good challenge to learn new skills and duties and adapt. I loved getting to meet with new people and grow professional relationships and skills.\r The only downside is that as a consultant firm, work there is dependent on what work is available. If you finish with a role and there are no positions open for your skills Accenture will hold out for a good amount of time and provide people that put their best into getting you staffed, but if nothing comes of it then that's the end of the job. Regardless, it is a fantastic company to work for and I would strongly recommend it to anyone interested."

I came in hoping to get some good hands on experience but I ended up doing things that did not align with my career.

Accenture,1a4t8hfm2as13egp,4,Fair compensation but promotions system needs work.,senior consultant,"Great company to work for if you are a working mom and have a partner/spouse that can be more hands-on with the kid(s).  \r If you get to work with a Manager or Sr. Manager that has been at Accenture more than 10 years you'll benefit greatly!!!  They are great\r Benefits are great.  Health benefits are covered 80%.  A share purchase plan that motivates you to make the company profitable.  Discounted hotel stays for personal trips because many of the major chains are clients.  \r  Compensation is fair when you compare health and other benefits to other firms and compensation.  \r Promotion/Evaluation needs work.  You could bust your hump and get 'Exceed' 2 fiscal years in a row and not get promoted.  \r  Merged/Acquired companies need to be brought in/broken up more.  Getting a role where the leadership from the new members of the firm are very closely guarded.  A very Us vs. The Accenture Team.  \rSadly, that means you could be rolled of a project or not considered for a role; not because you don't have the skills, but, because a friend wants to join Accenture now that the old firm was acquired or their buddy/lady friend is on the bench too long after their last role.  \r If you start on a project from day 1 one, stay their as long as possible and leave after 18 - 24 months for ANOTHER ground-zero project.  That gets you in 2 review cycles and could put you in a better position for a promotion."

Followed by about 4 weeks of Intensive training in your field. You then put onto a project where it's up to you to sink or float. No hand holding here.

Accenture,1a4bhb8utas0sant,3,Shark tank,Digital Senior Principal,"Accenture is a huge volume of Type A people.  That tied to the meritocracy 20-70-10 differentiation scheme converts to many people managing up and not down.  If you remember to do your own work first and help others second you will do well here.  \r The management hierarchy is matrixed which means you have a Deployed to Entity Lead, and possibly several people in that group assigning tasks, a Career Counselor whose primary focus is to represent your interests, and other leaders depending on your role and level.  There are many great people here and the key is to find a role that is a good fit without under-hiring.  As I titled this in the Review summary, Accenture is a shark tank that you're thrown into and expected to start swimming, building a network and making sure you cover.  If you do not do well building your own brand you may find it difficult depending on your role.\r The hardest part of the job was the extremely long hours over an extended period of time and being staffed on projects with a small percentage of people with previous experience.\r The best part of the job was working with some seriously smart and driven people."

From there my time is spent making sure that tickets are properly created and sent to the proper team to resolve the incident. Then lastly, reports are generated at scheduled times to be sent to show the productivity from the help desk to create tickets and resolve the clients issues. \r Management helps place tickets in different priorities so that either they are working to get issues resolved with the client or they are helping the help desk know which tickets needed to be updated and resolve quicker. \r My co-workers and I continue to work together each day asking questions and assisting each other to make sure that the overall goal to resolve incidents is completed. \r I have learned a lot about INTEL when you are dealing with incidents. The life cycle process and how to process request and what is required to be done to resolve the incident.\r The hardest part of my job is not being able to comprehend certain request from management or clients.\r The most enjoyable part of my day when I am able to resolve an incident for the client and in a timely matter."

Accenture,19updogqbak5p8ke,2,Large company with disconnected Management Team,Service Delivery Lead,Large company that always states they want input but when provided they hold it against you.  Consistently talk about work/life balance but look for long hours if you wish to get ahead.  They tend to overwork folks until they burn out and move on.  Hold employees to highest standards of productivity in industry but at average salaries.  They tend to price their contacts to customers targeting 31% bottom line return when 15% average in industry which puts the additional production requirements on the day-to-day employees.

Accenture,19uc8cgf75ndiabi,1,Worst Company I have ever worked for! (and I've been at some bad ones!),Manager,"They talk a good game but unfortunately the best part about going to work for ACS is the recruiting experience, it's all downhill from there!\r The epic and constant failure of Upper and Executive management is continual, they constantly fail to properly forecast and therefore the workers are left working 12-14 hour days.  Since ACS is a vendor to a very large bank in America, it will promise the world then work employees long hours to make it happen. I know the end of the month in the Mtg industry can be busy, but this place takes it to a whole new level.  'Just do it' seems to be a good motto for Nike, but in ACS language it means 'work this late and defective file, by the way, it's a same day closing'...  What's needed is work life balance but what we received was a remodeled lunch room in a leased building (oh - by the way, there went your bonus).\r If a person tells the truth and refuses to 'drink the Kool Aid' and waive the company pom-poms, the chances of earning a promotion are slim, no matter how good you are, but don't worry, they promote their favorites and I was personally told by Exec Mgt. one person in particular they promoted was chosen because she would do as she was told, in other words she would never rock the established management team with great ideas and fresh perspectives.\r ACS has a 36% turn over rate, exceedingly high even by industry standards; in my opinion, employee burnout, poor management, and working environment is the issue.  Some employees are motivated and offer great ideas, but I have seen great process improvement ideas not generated by"

Accenture,19rssmjm4b83b8fg,2,Big public firm that cares only about the bottom-dollar,Analyst/Senior Analyst,"I do think it depends where you end up and who you end up working with, but Accenture as a whole has come across as a firm that cares only about the profit. Individual growth, though encouraged in conversation, isn't truly supported outside of the rhetoric. This point itself was frustrating for me, who just came out of college hoping that a bigger firm with Accenture would allow for mobility and invest in training. I wasn't able to do either, despite constant articulation of my strong desires to do so. Accenture management will tell you that there are resources available for you to do trainings and learnings yourself, but most new hires are put onto projects with no real down-time to allow for such activities.\rA lot of smart, knowledgeable people work at Accenture, but most are above a certain age and few truly care about relaying that information to younger employees. The knowledge I gained on my project has come more from the client I work for than internally within Accenture, which shouldn't be the case for a firm that touts their strong company culture."

This process is often looked down upon by clients, which does not help your reputation if you decide to leave the firm.  I was pressured non-stop to up sell and find new leads even though that was not my area of expertise.  If you are not into being a full time sales person, avoid Accenture.

Don't get marred down in what the 'problem' is; come up with a solution and move on. \rIn my experience no 2 days are a the same. You have to be able get your day to day duties complete and handle all of the days surprises. Meet each deadline. Keep the lines of communication open.

Accenture,19ecufpio5n8gfam,4,Most Amazing People,Consultant,"Your work day completely depends on the industry, client, and project you end up getting staffed on. This is actually a huge pro because you learn so much in such a short amount of time and have the opportunity to work with a wide range of people - vendors, client, and Accenture co-workers (not always pleasant, but you're exposed to a lot). This is why other companies LOVE hiring ex-consultants. Another perk: if you don't like your project - it will END. During my 4+ years I was on about 7 different projects. Some people will stay on a single project for years, but again, if you hate it, there are ways out.\r Part of consulting is the inevitability of travel. Some people like it and some don't. There is always the possibility of working locally, but it's a toss up. Expect to fly in to your client location Monday morning and fly out Thursday afternoon/evening at the very least. When you're in crunch time, you can also end up staying until Friday and sometimes even the weekend, but for me, that was the exception. For me personally, my work/life balance was great and I liked the travel (oh! the airline miles! the hotel points! per diem! visiting another city!). During my travels, I also got to meet so many truly wonderful people, which brings me to my next point, the PEOPLE.\r You know how every company says they have great people, or they value their unique culture? Bla bla bla. Accenture actually lives this. Our main resource is our people and I have made so many life-long friends working here. You end up with the most unbelievable network of co-workers, friends, and supporters."

Accenture,19dm4p2ql5ncgera,3,"Balance great, pay sucks",Management Consultant,"I\'ll start by saying Accenture is a great company. It seems to be well managed at the enterprise level, and the projects I\'ve worked on tend to be staffed with and managed by very capable people as well. The work itself is not terribly exciting, but what would you expect from a company that makes its name implementing ERP solutions for most of its clients.\r The benefits are great; you get more PTO then you\'d probably ever need. And as long as you are respectful of your project\'s timeline when requesting to take vacation, few managers will deny the request. That said, the pay is underwhelming, and if you are promoted from within rather than an external hire, the raises are insulting. \r Moreover, HR is truly awful. The company is continually realigning its workforce into groups with increasingly arbitrary names, which only have the effect of confusing its employees and limiting their ability to choose fulfilling roles. The company recruits many of its consultants on the promise of choice - that one they enter the general consulting ""pool"" they will be able to select roles that interest them. The reality is much different. The internal staffing folks were clearly sent from corporate h*** to plague the rest of the workforce. They have a specific purpose to align demand (hundreds of unfillable roles that promise unchallenging college freshman-level work) to supply (consultants who would prefer to have some say in their next role), and their existence alone is motivation to stay off the bench (unstaffed)."

Accenture,195jmrchvak8gf1u,4,Accenture Federal Services,Alcohol and Drug Control Officer,"I worked as a contractor under the AFS section. \r Stability: Please note if you work as a contractor for AFS, much of budget and job stability resides on the federal side. They have cuts, even a contract cannot save your position. We had a 5 year contract, with an addendum to review every year, and I see why. They cut 10% of our project and although Accenture tried to place those 10%, they could not place everyone. \r Career advancement: None as a contractor unless they promote you to a different position (one person did get promoted to a Direct Project Manager after one vacated the position)\r Benefits: Benefits are awesome. I felt very compensated. Also, the additional benefits really made it seem like I was making more than I was.\r Leadership: The leadership I had were all great. Very respectful and courteous, as well as trying to give praise. I appreciate that. However, I felt there was not enough leadership per personnel managed, so sometimes I believed them to be overwhelmed with emails due to slow response time. (For example, I believe each DPH had 55-75 personnel to manage for the project) \r Overall, this is a great company. They handle things professionally and do their best to take care of their employees, which I believe was limited by the clients sometimes.\r In the end, I left for more money, career advancement, and stability, which this position was unable to provide."

The benefits are good, dress code is flexible (even though they send out a dress code policy that no one follows) and the charity/social events they host are a way they encourage their employees to stay active and involved. Around the world at other locations, I'm sure it's good.\r However, San Antonio Delivery Center at Fairgrounds Pkwy location is the worst place to work at if you decide to apply or you're referred through someone who works there as a Transaction Processing Associate/Representative. Within 2 years, 13 people have left the project because of poor management, leadership, team, communication, preferential treatment, and rude/unfair workload. Out of those 13, only 2 actually were able to move to a different project. If I can help the next person who thinks about applying, please don't waste you're time applying for this position. It's a set up and truly not worth the stress and unfair treatment. Trust me, the money is not worth it. Apply for another position there if you really must but not this one. Although the experience can be a lesson, the leads will fool you and make you believe they care about you only to question you and your personal life if you have a family member pass away. Again, the company is good, it just all depends on the team and/or project you're on. Every other team seems to keep their workers and appreciate them. However, this team is NOT a team. Again, don't apply for this position at this location. They'll start you off at 28-29K no matter if you have a college degree"

Accenture,18v9dfb0gak4gepk,1,"Great Company, Worst Project And location EVER",Transaction Processing Representative,"If you're looking for a good company to apply, this company is great. The benefits are good, dress code is flexible (even though they send out a dress code policy that no one follows) and the charity/social events they host are a way they encourage their employees to stay active and involved. Around the world at other locations, I'm sure it's good.\r However, San Antonio Delivery Center at Fairgrounds Pkwy location is the worst place to work at if you decide to apply or you're referred through someone who works there as a Transaction Processing Associate/Representative. Within 2 years, 13 people have left the project because of poor management, leadership, team, communication, preferential treatment, and rude/unfair workload. Out of those 13, only 2 actually were able to move to a different project. If I can help the next person who thinks about applying, please don't waste you're time applying for this position. It's a set up and truly not worth the stress and unfair treatment. Trust me, the money is not worth it. Apply for another position there if you really must but not this one. Although the experience can be a lesson, the leads will fool you and make you believe they care about you only to question you and your personal life if you have a family member pass away. Again, the company is good, it just all depends on the team and/or project you're on. Every other team seems to keep their workers and appreciate them. However, this team is NOT a team. Again, don't apply for this position at this location. They'll start you off at 28-29K no matter if you have a college degree"

I then set to performing tasks to make the project successful and add value where I am able. For implementation projects, this consists of cutting down time to do tasks where applicable and conforming to timelines. For support work, it is trying to improve processes where I can and conforming to Service Level Agreements in the contract. Of course there is also a level of report that I build with my clients to make the flow of dialogue natural.\r Accenture management, at least on the projects I have been on, has been good about managing the work load and giving good feedback when required. Co-workers are enjoyable to work around and everyone seems to be able to pull together, even in projects with tough aggressive timelines.\r The hardest part of the job can be the workload. Sometimes we are required to work sixty or more hours in a week.

Accenture,18mi3r827ak4g99i,3,"Huge Company, Talented People, Political",Finance Specialist,"Excellent work from home opportunities and PTO availability.  \r Political and painful to push agendas through due to layers upon layers of approvals.  For internal projects, team size can escalate quickly to the point of inefficiency.  Increasing size and complexity can also make it difficult to find internal ""experts"" with answers...few people want to take accountability for their inputs.  Segmented operations perpetuates territorial mentality and pointing of fingers.  \r Their sense of ""fun"" seems engineered and artificial.  Not many people seem to truly enjoy their actual work (not a new phenomenon)...here, likely due to the overly critical approval process (opposite of collaboration), which strips away autonomy and trust.\r It seems they pay a lot of ""lip service"" to job transfer flexibility and opportunities to move abroad within the company...the reality is that it\'s far more challenging and narrow minded than they portray.   \r Job satisfaction may be dependent on the direct team you are working with.  A good portion of leadership lacks emotional intelligence / people awareness and can make the job more painful than it needs to be.  Good leaders (and there are a few here) with a sense of work/life balance, coupled with an awareness of people\'s personal and professional goals can make all the difference for job satisfaction.\r Difficult to relate to Accenture service offerings and really get excited about what Accenture does.  While delivering valuable and necessary services...easy to feel distanced / discredited from the end result since there are so many intermediaries"

Once a company decided to hire an employee, we wrote offer letter for him, put the employee information into our system, and notify all the related facility of the employee's admission. Then we prepared labor contract for him. When an employee of the company transfers to other position, we changed his information in system, prepared a new contract for him and notified his line manager and other related facility. When an employee exit, we notified all related staff and prepared exit letter for him. These are basically what I did every day. Yet what I learnt is not only the skills described above, but also the joyful environment between colleagues. Colleagues are all nice and helpful. Leaders have lunch with employees and everyone is proud of working there. This is the most enjoyable part of the job because no matter how hard the work is, you will be encouraged and spirited by your co-workers, warmed by your leaders. This is also a success in management. The hardest part is the process of learning and focusing on details. Because the importance of what we do and big loads of cases everyday, a tiny error, for example on labor contract, will incur big trouble, everyone needs to be very careful, especially for me, a new learner.

(I had 2 promotions in 5 years). \r Management is a mixed bag. Younger managers can have limited experience due to the rapid promotions.

Accenture,186irsmiv5ncgfam,3,Occasional feelings of great accomplishment,Quality Control Specialist,"As an outsourcing company, Accenture is a world leader. They have an impressive track record of taking business processes over from clients with struggling performance and turning things around, adding value, updating processes, and improving performance. By utilizing offshore labor whenever possible, they get things done, for less. They are a major employer with a business presence everywhere in the world.  That is what Accenture does. They write contracts that contain a lot of ""Service Level Agreements"" which promise performance improvements and predictable and consistent results in exchange for money. The Client gets the improvements and writes the checks. A typical day at work depends greatly on whether you work directly on a part of the business that is measured critically as it is part of a ""Service Level Agreement."" These parts of the business are very structured, highly monitored, data is collected and processes are controlled. You are constantly aware that there are metrics being gathered and your performance is being relied upon every day to ""make the numbers."" If you are in a part of the business that is not directly reported to the client according to the Service Level Agreements, then your day depends on your own self-motivation and the level of involvement that your boss has in the results of the team that you are on. My co-workers are, polished professionals in their fields, mostly self-managed. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the wild fluctuation in the volume of work. Getting everyone to perform their processes completely and correctly no matter"

Accenture,186hhbb2fb84g8fi,3,Roller coaster workplace with a lot of uncertainty,Software Engineering Analyst,"Due to the nature of consulting work there will be periods of time where you will be on the ""bench"" and not staffed on a project.  During this time you essentially have no control over what happens in your career.  There are many training courses available, however taking specific courses does not guarantee a project which will utilize said skills.\r The opportunity looks great on the surface as it boasts travel, fast paced environments, etc.  But it falls short in execution.  You really don\'t have any control over what projects you are staffed at and are given the ""you need to be flexible"" speech from HR if you try and log a complaint.\r Overall if you are looking for a relatively easy paycheck and don\'t mind getting staffed places that you have little to no interest in, it is a great place to work.  If you are looking for an entry level job to build experience with a certain set of skills, look elsewhere."

Adobe,1f656vis1o1gm800,5,They added benefit before you knew you needed them.,Software Engineer,"Always looking out for their employees,  Excellent employer.   They think of benefits that you need before you could think to ask. Can't say enough good about them."
Adobe,1f4d3v3ffsa8r800,5,a creative place to work in,Designer,I enjoyed collaborating with different creatives on projects. The work environment was fast paced but rewarding. There were constantly new projects to work on and old projects to finish. 
Adobe,1f3rajlavu1vt800,1,Toxic Woke climate,Senior Product Manager,"Adobe is unfortunately a Terrible  place to work. I just transitioned from acquisition company and I am completely stunned at how political the climate is here. So called ""Adobe for all"" is nothing more than corporate cancel culture. Unless you have the right skin color or other preferences   it\xe2\x80\x99s barely even covert you are to keep your mouth shut. Work elsewhere is my recommendation "
Adobe,1evqa4cg426a4000,4,Time for work and play,Quality Engineer,"It was great to work on software that helped people's productivity and creativity. People are treated like adults who can manage their time efficiently. There is a stocked kitchen, video game consoles, pingpong, etc. Benefits are generous.  "
Adobe,1et7k5lr5p113800,5,Rewarding and challenging,Product Management,"It's a great place to work. Rewarding and flexible, with a focus on employee well-being. The best people rise to the top, usually. I feel appreciated and rewarded for the work I do."
Adobe,1erv4iadv2v70000,2,Too political,Enterprise Security Engineer,I recommend people who wants to work here to learn to be more political than being smart. I had a manager that was managing the division like 7-11. That's why i quit. 
Adobe,1erjuslks3084000,2,Well paid to sweat the details ,Director,Good fundamentals and strategy but needs a qualified COO. Command and control culture in some groups. Holiday shutdowns are good practice and benefits are solid. 
Adobe,1eoj7ifetu44g800,3,Stagnant Corporation Masquerading as Tech Innovator,IT Solutions Architect,"Adobe has two good products, photoshop and Acrobat (PDF Reader). They have had these two products for over two decades. All other product releases failed. Yes, some people use them, but any usage is strictly attributable to Adobe\xe2\x80\x98s brand recognition, and not the actual proficiency of the product. The culture at Adobe is bland. It is nonexistent, it is cold. None of the budget is allocated towards team morale activities. During my 15 months there, I think there was one happy hour. Their technology is a mess, their leader ship is embarrassing, and worst of all, the company has no clear-cut direction. Nobody can actually tell you what the company is working towards. Essentially, Photoshop pays the bills and that\xe2\x80\x99s all that matters."
Adobe,1en7n8p1oo22b800,2,Egos and politics ,Director,"Too many egos once you are director level or above. Too many layers of mgmt and egos to work around to get anything done. Adobe knows b2c but still has no clue on B2B mid market and SMB.  Likes to buy solid MM companies, keep the mgmt team for a year and then they all leave or are let go...Marketo, Magento, Echo Sign, and more are good examples. "
Adobe,1emf8e5i7npup800,5,"Good perks, insurance and education benefits",Support Consultant,A lot of product team(support and sales) in India works in night shifts unless you are in the core engineering team. Rest everything is good.Not many IJP opportunities. so learn and move out

Adobe,1ekn7hj38nph9800,5,Good culture with decent work,Software Developer Intern,Interned at Adobe during the summer. I found the team and the people around to be helpful. The company culture is unmatched. Ownership of product is encouraged.
Adobe,1ekg4ut24npj5800,4,Great company,Project Manager,"I love the company but the teams can be hit or miss. Most teams are based in SF/San Jose so if you want to advance, location is something to keep in mind."
Adobe,1eicd5u3kree1800,5,I learn a lot here. ,Flash Player Quality Engineer,My Manager is really great. Help me to clear understand with the work instruction and goal and support in each way to succeed in those goal. I learn a lot here. 
Adobe,1eg1u7qi53djs000,3,bureaucratic & process oriented organization,Engineering Manager,"Could be good or bad, depending on what you want. Adobe is process defined organization, hence things move slowly.You will need lot of approvals from various set of stakeholders, which points a lot of accountability on your head."
Adobe,1e7r5uqgrovee800,5,Fun and Productive Environment to Work in,Cloud Data Analyst,It feel's young with people full of energy with nice office environment one can image.  Team work is a must and many technical meeting by developers of all levels to review and form new actionable ideas.
Adobe,1e6uq1k0n32s7000,4,Great company for individuals truly interested in technology,BI Consultant,"Great place for truly talented individuals seeking to make a difference, but the work culture seems to have taken a hit in recent years especially in business organizations."
Adobe,1e65419qso1u7800,2,Beware,Quality Engineer,"There are good managers and bad ones. Hopefully you get a good one. They prioritize diversity to the point that it becomes detrimental. It would be one thing if internal diversity were commensurate with the community at large, however, that is not the case. The end result is the reverse discrimination. Good luck."
Adobe,1e5q8icdhqe38800,4,Great and stable company if you're full-time,Media Analyst,"I loved working at Adobe, but being a contractor made me feel like a second class citizen. My team was great, but there was no room for advancement and I was stonewalled when I wanted to pursue more advanced tasks and projects and take on more responsibility. TVC culture is a pox and actively works against individual growth. But the cafeteria was great I guess."
Adobe,1e5pnvq39qe38800,4,Good team work,Data Analyst,"As an individual contributor, you really have a lot of autonomy in the work you do and can make big plays with your team. Orders don't come down from executives -- the teams decide what they want to do and how to do it, start to finish, on their own terms. You of course get direction and insight from people higher up, but engineers, product managers, designers, and business stakeholders all work together in autonomous teams to make things happen. As a Data Analyst, your work is always high impact, and you get to shape how your team operates."
Adobe,1e5j3fbeeqe2s802,3,Ping Pong,Technical Marketing Manager,"As a contractor, there seems to be a negative treatment to contractors versus full-time employees. Contractors are not provided there own workspace, and each day bumped to other locations. Adobe\'s amenities are not equally provided to all employees, just full-timers. This treatment makes a person feel like an outcast in a culture that is pretty cool for those that are brought on full-time. Contribution to the success of the business is equal, however, not culture.\r My specific manager did not have emotional intelligence and treated her subordinate poorly, even those that were full-time. \r Other teams I worked with seemed very happy, and their bosses were pretty friendly and eager to help other teams.\r The work itself was excellent, and the experience of utilizing one of the most powerful marketing platforms and analytics to generate interest in Adobe\'s products and services was a privilege and would enjoy working there if offered a position ""full-time."" One lousy boss out of many was just bad luck."
Adobe,1e5gevoemppaj802,4,N/a,Financial Analyst Intern,"Very awesome experience. The people are genuine, happy to help. I was able to learn from across the company. You just need to reach out to people. Good luck"
Adobe,1e4rrnp6don66802,4,Great Culture. Slow Growth,Sales,I enjoyed my time at Adobe. I learned and grew in my career. The Sales culture is different than the overall company culture. Advancing and feeling secure don't come with the sales role.
Adobe,1e3j003k2oc91800,1,Lack of mission and focus at every level,Senior Project Manager,This is very siloed company. Each group operates under a different management structure. The management structures vary from agile to okr to their own inventions. \r Innovation is stymied by the lack of coordination between teams.\r  Overall a very top down environment.
Adobe,1e35mn47iocrn802,5,Great place to stick around if you have an ever-evolving role,"Lead Infrastructure Engineer, IT Client Services","As a member of IT, I've had the pleasure of speaking/working with folks from almost every type of role within the company. There is so much opportunity here at Adobe, but some roles may leave little room for advancement and require lateral moves in order to allow for upward mobility. \r Although my IT org doesn't allow for work-from-home opportunities, the offices are very accommodating in terms of comforts and productivity needs. I left a job that allowed for 100% remote work so that I could commute and show up here every day, and I have no complaints about it.\r Pay is alright. Competitive rates for IT are definitely out there, considering the growing scope of work for IT roles here. \r The benefits here are excellent. I really get a brain break during the bi-annual shutdowns (a week during July 4th and a week during Christmas/New Years).\r Management is management. They're not always skilled to have a comprehending head in the foxholes with members of the roles they oversee, so this can be frustrating when their personality lacks empathy on top of unfamiliarity of inner workings. This isn't specific to Adobe, it's just how managers can be anywhere you go. Maybe more promotion from within would help here, but sometimes personalities are more important that backgrounds when it comes to leadership."
Adobe,1e33h9capocft804,3,"If you work in Adobe, don't do it in a remote office",Sr Product Manager,"Comp was good, especially the stock purchase plan. Worked in the NYC but most decisions made in San Jose without input. Management in company is not so great. If you're not working on one of the core products, you're not treated so well. Meh..."
Adobe,1e2gqtfs3f22n802,5,Great company overall,Graphic Designer/Production Artist,"I love Adobe and what they stand for, it gets me energized hearing about it at each employee meeting. Overall it's fantastic, and I can't ask for anything better, but it can be very PC and hard to grow your career upwards."
Adobe,1e2e9h17af22o800,4,Nice place to work if Adobe has good projects,QA Engineer,"Good projects to work on but recently the head hancos they are sending work to overseas, so basically stealing jobs from America and sending to overseas."

Adobe,1e027t850bmlg802,2,A typical Bay area company,Software Engineer,Please don't get carried away by name. It's a typical bay area company. They do fire employee more often then any other big companies so there is nothing like job security.

Adobe,1dutf8dhc4s9h803,5,My current manager is difficlt to deal with,Software Developer,"I love working at Adobe. I think the overall culture is great, most people that I've talked to have been supportive and genuine. I do think that my current issue is with my current management. My current manager often behaves like a bully and I currently feel defeated by the way that we interact. I do not think that I'm given a lot of respect or trust, and I believe that my career is currently hindered by that."
Adobe,1duisi6olo9ru801,5,Productive and fun workplace with good benefits,Software Quality Engineer,"I had a very good time working at Adobe. Decent work/life balance and good benefits. I only left to go back to software development, but for a QA it's a very good company."

Adobe,1dsrc2kiop04r802,3,Bad behavior by well tenured managers,Service position working closely with executives,Managers don\xe2\x80\x99t know the job market because they have been there 17+ years. Bullies because they have \xe2\x80\x9cfriends\xe2\x80\x9d. Some act as if they are the title of their managers and are mentally brutal at time because they know the culture more than the newbies.
Adobe,1ds0aejgbh3kh802,5,Adobe really cares about employee retention.,Software Engineer III,"I worked at Magento, an Adobe company. The takeover was smooth, and we were all well compensated. Some offices were closed, but employees there were offered relocation, helped with visas, and more.\rFrom what I've seen, Adobe employees tend to actually care about the company a lot. The social side of the work is always buzzing, from slack to regular events, hackathons, happy hours, and festive celebrations.\rWorkwise... a strange support of open plan offices is the only nit I can pick, the management supports and encourages you to stretch yourself outside the box of merely working Kanban tickets day in and day out: you're encouraged to pick up projects to work on, give presentations to others about them, and so on."
Adobe,1drbmcacd1d0s002,3,World Wide Adobe Managed Services,"Administrative Assistant 4, Worldwide Managed Services","The business culture is very respectful in the interactions with the employees, sharing of resources and polite manners.

Adobe,1dhvjkuftb8am802,2,Horrible culture and coworkers,Project Manager,"Adobe is a growing company with tons of opportunities. Unfortunately, the group I was in had awful culture. My manager would use improper language to criticize how I look in my employee picture, and she never really worked with me to develop a plan for my career growth even if I was fully prepared to discuss.  \rThe remote culture made me ( as a new hire) had no one to interact with everyday in the office. I was always alone even though most people in my team were based in the city that I was located. I couldn't build any relationship and I couldn't experience any Adobe culture other than joining the company meetings. People were gossiping and were speaking ill of others behind their backs, which is so unprofessional. If you are looking for a great working culture, then I don't think Adobe is a good place for you."
Adobe,1dgttechfb81r800,5,Wow,Technical Account Manager,"I was hired in December. I knew that Adobe was a good company when I applied but as I found out more about it during the interview and job offer process, I was absolutely amazed. The benefits and perks are easily superior to any other company I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever worked for.

Adobe,1d4avphgk5ncs800,5,Best place I have ever worked,Executive Assistant,"Working at Adobe, the pace varies by the business. There isn't a typical work day which I love. Working in Sales, Adobe allows you to be a brand within a brand which I love. I have a manager that allows me to jump in wherever I feel and learn. This enables me to develop my position outside of the job job description. The culture in NYC is every bit of the feel of family. We are very close; work hard and play hard. It is a very collaborative, team environment. The hardest part of the job is when you lose deals. It feels personal when you see your teammates lose a deal or not be able to close a deal. I enjoy everything about my job. I love my manager, he is absolutely the best!!! He is more than a manager, he is my family. I love my co-workers. When big events happen for them, they happen for me as well. When they hurt, I hurt. I LOVE MY JOB!!!!"

The on-call are in rotation for our site, so there will always be somebody available for urgent breakdown.  The daily work include high priority tickets and critical projects that need to be completed.  The workplace culture is awesome."
Adobe,1d1uiivgqb85o800,4,Adobe can be a great place to work,"Senior Art Director, Adobe Studio","PROS: They have a great corporate culture, great benefits, very competitive pay, most people are very friendly and you get to work and collaborate with very knowledgeable co-workers, generally speaking, a great work/life balance, flexible schedules (as long as you get your work completed), can sometimes work remotely, a great in-house cafeteria that is nominally subsidized, a gym at work,  and  top--level talent.\r CONS: It all depends who you work for: if you don\'t have the support of your manager it can severely limit your opportunities for career advancement or training/cross-functional learning opportunities. They tend to keep people siloed doing one particular function, and do not really promote expanding your skillset. There is a ""tuition reimbursement"" program, but it is completely not a guarantee that you will be reimbursed, and you need to get the approval of your manager before you can even seek it out. Many people at Adobe have been lucky to have encouraging managers who mentored them and always presented them with opportunities to grow professionally - I was not lucky in that arena. There were many, many ways that my manager could have helped facilitate this, and I flagged it in every review, but it fell on deaf ears. That\'s the one thing I regret about staying at Adobe as long as I did - I think I would have learned so much more moving around to different positions at other companies. The corporate culture is so good, the products are amazing, and I was working with a team of people who almost felt like family\xe2\x80\x94so I got lazy and complacent and stayed way too long."

Most of the locations are state of the art, with excellent cafeterias, gyms, and other on-site benefits.  Adobe's financial performance is hard to duplicate. They've achieved double-digit growth for 3+ years, which is difficult for a company of their size and age.  Most of this growth is due to Adobe's migration to the saas model which, while controversial at the time, has allowed them to considerably increase their revenues, especially within creative cloud.  I would strongly suggest working for Adobe."

I have been there for five years, received perfect reviews, and have never been promoted despite asking for it repeatedly. Most of the leadership is only concerned with Wall Street and not employees or our customers.

They were always aware of what the market was doing and what worked and didn\'t work. They knew the royalty business of PostScript would gradually decline and that Applications revenue would have to take over, which it overwhelmingly did! Every product release had to make money.\r My experience there was that they valued my work and didn\'t seem to care that I had no college education at the time. They said ""we liked your work on Photoshop. Would you like to take on Reeltime?"" (I renamed it to Adobe Premiere). If you created a test file you might see it on a product demonstration. You had a chance to name a new product. Your input for new features was always considered. I valued the fact that most of the directors were engineers. The CEO and President had an open door policy.\r The company increased in size to 3,500 employees by the time I left in 1999.

Research show that 1 in 10 customers complaints are because the customer is correct but that the majority of the time he/ she is not.  Alleviating the issue for the customer based on that old fact alone can be challenging.  I find  it to be a great learning expereince for both parties; the customer and myself .  Often times, I am able to alleivate the customers issue by simply educating the customers on the product or service at hand.

However, as time went by, I felt myself fighting the plight to become a cog in the industrious and social-media driven machine\xe2\x80\x94Efforts to improve workflows were overlooked, chaos seemed to reign in almost every project that was set forth, and Team Leads and Coordinators failed to address relevant points without complicating an issue further.Of course, to add more salt to the wound, nevermind that you will also get to see that primal greedy side of people at all times (both company-wise and clients): Yeah, a client might be in the wrong here and there, but in truth, the website/app can be convoluted and depending on who tends to your case: Good Luck with getting a refund! As for my ex-teammates: Good luck with moving forward and/or repeating yourself relentlessly and/or disengaging or even apologizing for technological misgivings or misunderstandings which are out of your control. My greatest disappointment was being a part of the first Covid-19 related workflow overhaul. My Team and I were not clear on what to do most of the time (regardless of Leads stepping in and playing make-believe support). It was a poor attempt at dealing with a crisis, and sadly, it showed.

And I have received 4-6 other coupons worth $100 that I have been unable to use because they expired before I even knew I had them, and I did have a $3.00 coupon that went through amazingly- who knows what that was for. Although I am happy to be able to share my home and get paid for it through Airbnb i would rate them just as they rate me. Almost a super job after 5  years of being a super host.  "

But as time went on there was constant change in policies and responsibilities creating highly stressful work enviorment. Imagine having things change on the platform and finding out about those changes from your clients and not internally. The product team, policy team, and the engineers were constantly making changes. Compensation was half of what was being offered for similar positions and responsibilities. But, I learned alot with them, all in all it was a great experience. But it was not easy. "

On a day-to-day basis, all you have to do is keep the house clean, provide clean linens and towels, and be nice to people - all things which I normally do anyway. \r Managing your listing includes creating and maintaining an attractive profile for your property, and responding promptly to all inquiries and booking requests. \r Ask your guests every day how their stay is going and if they need anything. This keeps the lines of communication open so if they have any concerns you can address them right away rather than letting the guest become frustrated - which can result in a poor review.\r What I enjoy most about this job is meeting new people from all over the country and the world. I've had guests from Germany, England, Sweden, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Hungary, as well as many of the US states.\r It can be a bit challenging to vet your potential guests to make sure you feel comfortable with them staying in your home. A few questions through the website messaging feature usually does the trick, although occasionally a phone call or assistance from Support are required.\r The Customer Support for Airbnb hosts is outstanding. I have had very positive experiences with them and they actually seem to care about your situation.\r I highly recommend hosting to anyone who enjoys meeting people and can maintain a service focus in their interactions with guests."

When they interview you they have someone from a different department do it but most times they don\'t have the same background or aren\'t really familiar with the job.

I worked for a Host and help cleaned her property and helped present and make her Airbnb apartment look nice and welcoming.
Airbnb,1dofnplqkb82n802,1,Worst Job I've worked at,Call Center Representative,"This job is driven by numbers and you are rarely ever able to switch your schedule due to your numbers. Keep in mind these numbers are given by customers, who arent always happy so they may give you a 0-5 and ruin your NPS which they use to decide if you will be changing your schedule or not even if it is impacting your health because your hours suck and dont coordinate around your life outside of work. They will NOT change your schedule unless you're going to college and need to change accordance to your school schedule which you have to bring a copy in to prove THATS YOUR schedule. This company does NOT care about their employees. They are way to strict. You can't even have a simple candy bar on the floor without being written up. Drinks? Forget about it! Might as well keep all your belongings in your car. Dont forget how often they change things around on the floor and schedules. New seating every week practically, never the same manager. FORGET ABOUT SUPPORT your managers on the floor, are all friends and take their breaks at the same time, so whenever you have a question involving a case or have a guest asking to speak to a manager there is hardly ever anyone available. This then results in bad surveys because the guest is waiting forever on the phone on hold or awaiting a call back so they get angry. I would NOT recommend working for Airbnb-Sutherland. You will be extremely stressed, over worked, and sleep deprived. FORGET about calling in to about your car breaking down or a sickness. They expect you here no matter what. Car breaks down, use uber or lyft even if you dont"

Thanks for that opening!\r - The CRM is bad enough that you might think you are talking to \'person X\' but once your message is sent, \'Person Y\' has successfully read it! So if you didn\'t get that urgent text response explicitly requested, well, \'there was an attempt\' - but someone else got your message. Because, well:\r Your Zendesk implementation = Hot Garbage. Also, start doing iteration and stop \'a/b testing\' a percent of a percent of a percent of your users. No one does this anymore. It is 2019. Being empathic is not going to increase your NPS. Being fast and near instantaneous resolution of basic, silly issues - increases NPS time and time again. Look at your engagement difficulty scores.\r - The phones are routed through so many switches that disconnects are frequent. In fact, one of the best parts of the job were being written up for \'viewing\' an account you were not authorized to view - which never really happened of course but, good luck proving it. Discuss with your manager and at best get that cooky-eyed ""Yep - sounds about right - here is your write-up\' response. Imagine: a guest is locked outside of a reservation and can\'t get in. They were nice enough to not yell at you the first two times you asked them to repeat themselves. Third time - not a charm. Also, your call authentication process is unnecessary, not required \'by law\' (who sold you on this?) and hokey.\r - Deductive"

If you need to work part time if your reason it not good enough or doesn't involve bettering your education they will not allow you to be part time. They tell you about getting a raise in pay but you are not able to due to the position you have so you never get a raise. They lie to you when they tell you nothing will ever change with your schedule then they will make the change without letting you know. Worst management I have ever had or worked for.

There is a lot of blame when things go wrong.  Wish it was better, and it seems to be getting a little better.  Many managers only have Airbnb experience.

The pay was pretty good but not amazing, however I definitely enjoyed the job. Basically you are a human customer service resource for customers to interact with. Most Amazon customers rarely have the chance to talk to an Amazon employee in person and the Retail Sales Consultant (RSC)position provides that service. You answer questions about Amazon products and give out general Tech advice. While there are items that you can sell this will not be something you are judged by your bosses. Amazon emphasizes that sales are not the priority of the position. They want customers to trust the RSC's advice and therefore build trust with Amazon's brand. Pushing sales and products a customer doesn't need are not what this position is about. If you have a fun team to work with the days will fly by. This job is for you if you like Tech, and interacting with strangers."

Be prepared to work very hard. "
Amazon,1flapv6f4ocrn801,1,Overworked ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Little pay for long hours. Consider this a temp job and nothing more than some quick money. Peak season is horrible. Management doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even notice you.

Amazon,1flajnrkes7is802,1,"High stress, low management. ",Picker,"I've been at the company since the beginning of summer. And in that first month, the manager I originally had for my department and shift quit. They have yet to be replaced. There isn't a lot of employees for the work load, especially going into the holiday season. They have a day during your days off that can be called in for mandatory over time, but they never ever mention that during peak season, you're working 5 days a week for 12.5 hours. As someone who lives an hour away from the work place, I don't get a healthy amount of sleep and typically don't have time to eat on the days that I work. But everyone's always up everyone's behinds on eating right and stretching because heaven forbid you get hurt, but with the quick rates you need to constantly be hitting, it's bound to happen and that'll tick all the managers off.

Amazon,1flaaut10s7is801,3,Great pay for the work,Package Handler,Some managers can be kind of incompetent and the hours and work can be pretty rough but the pay makes up for it. Started off at $15.50 and less than a year later I'm now making $18.30 and hour with no promotions. Since peak season started and I work weekends I get an extra $2 an hour. They sometimes offer 2x overtime pay so you can make $1k a week if you can get through 60 hour weeks.

Amazon,1fla77espo260800,4,Alright ,Transportation Specialist,Love that it's remote however there isn't really a sense of progression and some steps taken by management feel like it's going in the opposite direction overall it's a nice place to work a lot of MOT though
Amazon,1fla1s73es7is802,1,They’re horrible. ,Packer,"They are the worst job to try and get anything fixed with, the ERC and leave services are HORRIBLE and will NOT help you what so ever, they sit there and blame you for legit everything but don\xe2\x80\x99t actually ever help with anything at all, I would NOT recommend this horrible job to my worst enemy.

It\xe2\x80\x99s great excercise with plenty of bathroom breaks and 2 30 minute lunch breaks. Overall one of the best jobs I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had.

Started in pack singles(1 item per box) then transferred to AFE1(multi pack). Rates are attainable if you are willing to put the work into it. If you are someone that needs motivation this probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be the job for you. You will be on you feet for 9 hours of your 10 hour work day, so your feet the first week will be killing you. Make sure you have good support in you shoes. Amazon does give you $110 towards shoes, but you have to get them from Zappos.com. You have pretty good benefits right off the bat whether you start as seasonal or blue badge. If you start as seasonal you will get the chance to become a regular blue badge employee. Oh!!!! When you start the hire on process always, always watch your emails and the spam folder. Check the job posting that you applied on for any additional information you need to give them. Since starting this Amazon there has been 3 different GM\xe2\x80\x99s. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had 3 different area managers in single pack and about 6 different area managers in AFE. Amazon constantly moves the managers around for various reasons. Either the AM is promoted, transfers or leaves the company. Some of the AM\xe2\x80\x99s have never worked in that particular department. Even though there have been so many managers, I have never been treated badly or disrespected. You will come across some AM\xe2\x80\x99s that are not very interactive with the workers and focus on numbers and then you will find some that are \xe2\x80\x98people persons\xe2\x80\x99 and actually get to know you. But in all fairness, you have to put yourself out there as well. Go up to your AM and PA introduce"
Amazon,1fl8uen16ocrn801,1,Long hours,Package Handler,Long hours and hardly any pay. Pay increase is never there and cannot move up at all. Whole company has managers sitting around and can\xe2\x80\x99t get time off

I would recommend looking for another job while working here as it\xe2\x80\x99s just good if you need the bills payed.

Amazon,1fl84b9l5s7is802,1,Caution it's a trap unless you have a degree ,Warehouse Associate,Amazon is full of false promises and Mangers only care about themselves and their work not yours.To many Mangers for one shift and not enough employees. Pay is great but you will work for it and others will get the same amount of pay while doing less work and they will get praised for it because they are the Mangers favorite. So don't work hard because they don't care and others will get further while doing nothing but running their pue holes. You will need 2 jobs because hours are hard to come by.This is in Bristol Va
Amazon,1fl83o9mct4vo801,2,They expect way to much,Fufillment Associate,They manipulate your schedule at will and expect you to deal with it. My start date was even pushed ahead on me by a week.

Amazon,1fl7ut2g5n5co800,5,Great place to work!,Customer Service Associate,Working from home & Amazon is very flexible with us! Managers always know how to help in any way they can. Pay is decent. Lots of room to advance & move up.
Amazon,1fl7soa2eu1l4801,3,"Amazing benefits, inconsistent leadership",HR Business Partner,The organization is so large that many individual sites end up running almost as tiny organizations instead of with consistency from site to site.  For an able bodied flexible person willing to work hard the money is available to be made.  Growth is available and relatively quickly but at a cost to personal life.  The benefits are wonderful and the resources are available for employees if they ask the right questions and have the right leadership team.  Frustrations can come from a call center support for many smaller sites and a lack of correction when problems are brought up.
Amazon,1fl7nklahn59v800,4,Pay ,Warehouse Worker,The pay is good and good benefits the bad thing about Amazon is they work you hard and they push you extremely hard and it is not cool enough in the warehouse.
Amazon,1fl7l4elgo1e7800,2,It's a job,Flex Associate,You pack groceries into a bag and that's the whole job. No mobility.

Amazon,1fl7i25dcu1l4802,1,Management can be a hurdle to overcome,Onsite Medical Representative,"My time working as an OMR was very difficult, management was very hard to communicate with and a lot of the times would be gaslighting. I wouldn't want anyone to go through what I did working for this company. Management has no idea how healthcare works, as they are managers in safety. We had to constantly remind them of HIPPA and had no idea how to manage the OMR's. The worst thing was management would tell co-workers of mine to look for mistakes I would make, to point them out to me later on. When management would make mistakes and I would point them out, they would act like they did nothing wrong or take zero accountability for their actions. The same management still works there to this day in 2021-2022...."
Amazon,1fl75rvlct4vo800,4,Chill,Scanner/Picker,Decent pay and decent benefits. They pay for your shoes and you get an amazon discount. It felt like I was being paid to work out so I found it dope.  
Amazon,1fl70nig7t4vo800,4,Great company/ lack of compensation structure ,Transportation Specialist ROC,Love my leadership and the job I do but find the leadership principles are not being utilized at the company as much as they should be. Youth and lack of experience plays a large role in most of these lower management positions as college doesn't prepare most of these leaders with the tools needed to be program managers or manage a team. Which in turn teaches your leads the same bad habits. 
Amazon,1fl70c979s7is802,4,Productive ,Seasonal Associate,Great place to work. Very faced paced and a very flexible work schedule as a seasonal employee. Was able to work and also continue education and community service.

Just  like the associates if the head count is to high and not cost effective that day the tell you not to come in. As a manager they offer you a buy out to leave if you don\xe2\x80\x99t take it they evaluate you  in a month and say your not productive to company standards and just let you go. "
Amazon,1fl6ki9vmu1l4800,2,Too much work and less time for breaks,Stocker,"What I don't like is that it takes a physical toll your body at the end of the shift you can barely walk back to your car and on days off all you could do is lay down because your whole body be aching too much,I wish they could moderate the work,and hope that they will consider the use of machines to pick up heavy bags for the delivers to take and fo do their deliver"
Amazon,1fl6gt977osn4802,4,Good pay stable work,Warehouse Worker,Amazon overall is a good place to work. It pay is good the work is stable . The benefits are good you get overtime when needed. You work at your pace but there is benefits in working hard. There is chance to move up in the company.  I will give it a four stars for employees to work there. There is paid time off as well as vacation days . The work can get repetitive and your standing for long hours so if you are not use to it . It can take a toll on you.
Amazon,1fl65sjnbocrn800,3,All depends on station leaders ,Area Manager,Job has its perks but your experience will depend on the site management and whether or not they are micromanagers. The people you work with will usually make the job more enjoyable on a hectic day. 
Amazon,1fl622o30n59v801,5,Great,Fullfilment Associate,Great place to work in. I honestly did not expect the great treatment and supervisor I received. I am very happy with this job and I go to work every day knowing I\xe2\x80\x99m well taken cared of.
Amazon,1fl5pc3n2osn4800,5,Good pay,Amazon Warehouse Associate,Flexible schedule. Management non existent. As a person you don\xe2\x80\x99t matter to anyone. Do your job. Do it fast. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think about pausing to talk to anyone. They probably won\xe2\x80\x99t because they\xe2\x80\x99re too worried about making rate.

Amazon,1fl5fivfdosn4800,2,It was ok,Amazon Fresh Associate,Was Flex employee but shifts were hard to come by so had to take late night shifts. It was ok minus getting thrown into the freezer. Hope you don't need something cause management was terrible.
Amazon,1fl5fflo0n59v802,4,It's okay,Warehouse Associate,"If you last longer than a month at Amazon, you are a god. I worked third shift & they compensated me well for my work. It's insanely hard to get time off and they require 20 hours of overtime for the holidays. The team environment seems to be more from everyone just relating to the fact they hate their lives. I am younger and more in shape than most and the job was insanely hard on my body that has affected my wrists, knees and back majorly."
Amazon,1fl5am0p6u1l4800,3,it’s an alright place,Packer/Tote Runner,"if you can handle working long shifts being on your feet for 10 hours a day then it\xe2\x80\x99s fine other than that they pay fair wages on the different job titles, tote runners could use an extra buck or two tho averaging 15 miles a day running around the ware house for the same rate as a packer who probably gets a couple thousand steps in a day"
Amazon,1fl58f67qu1l4801,4,"Its not a bad place to work at, bonuses and benefits ",Warehouse Worker,"They give you nice bonuses here and there and I don't use their benefits but ive heard from others that they are amazing.

Amazon,1fl5821bms7is800,3,Mediocre job for fast cash ,Shopper,Extremely strange work culture that asks to push for micro managing of employees. This pushes a strange feeling of always being watched from HR even when using the bathroom 
Amazon,1fl57dchnn5co802,3,Always seems like a temporary job,FC Associate I,You will hardly ever move up from a part time position unless you butter up to higher ups a lot. Pay is great but the hours usually leave you wanting more especially for night shift. Management can hardly know if you're trained in anything or what work needs to be done. Am currently looking for other work opportunities b/c working here is only temporary even with a blue badge
Amazon,1fl55imqmn5co802,5,Very fun,Production Worker,It's a very good job to have on your resume. A solid ran company and very structured. The benefits are unparallel. Also offer tuition reimbursement.  
Amazon,1fl51v1e7t4vo800,2,Ok job if you need the money,Warehouse Worker,"Most days were stressful and management was not very helpful. When it came to breaks it was for 30 minutes, however the 30 minutes breaks felt more like 15 minutes due to the Time it take to warm food and get back to location "
Amazon,1fl51i3cen5co801,2,"Boring, dead end job",FC Associate I,"Working at Amazon is very demanding. I worked in several units at Amazon, I worked in their Prime Now division, fulfilment, and in one of their delivery stations. Working in Prime Now wasn't too bad, we still had quotas to meet, but as long as you didn't spend too long picking orders managers didn't bother you too much. The biggest issues are at the fulfillment centers, when I worked the pack lines, managers would be very nit picky about picking x number a units, and if you were too slow they would move you around, and if you weren't fast enough in the areas they moved you around to, they eventually get rid of you.  The delivery stations are high-pressured as well, because if you don't get the product out fast enough, then customers will be late getting their order. The hours at Amazon can be long, when I worked in fulfillment, I worked 4 ten-hours shifts during non-peak months, it was nice to have three days a week to do what I needed, but during peak I worked 5 12-hour shifts. However, Prime Now and the delivery stations were part-time, so it made it hard to make ends meet. Also, if you start off as a level 1, it is very difficult to move up, the managers are turned off by people below them who know more than them. I have a bachelor's degree, and it was impossible to move up. I was told, I would be better off quitting and reapplying to the position I wanted."
Amazon,1fl4sdjvrosn4800,2, Inconsistent,Learning Trainer,Inconsistent and doesn't consider employee retention the best pro I can give this company is its benefits package. To be honest my biggest issue is the lack of compensation the idea that a person can't negotiate their pay despite what they have accomplished and contributed to the company is inadequate.
Amazon,1fl4nu8o6n59v800,4,It's a job,Seasonal Warehouse Associate,"It's a job but not really a career. You come in, do your job, and go home. Management can be difficult at times trying to push numbers over quality. All in all the pay is fair and benefits are great."
Amazon,1fl4n2141u1l4801,5,Good for beginners their pay is above minimum unlike most companies,Warehouse Associate,The workplace is great for beginners and someone who has recently moved in the country or who doesn't know english but in order to move up the ladder it depends on your luck as of which department you get in and what management you work with
Amazon,1fl4fhkh5u1l4800,1,Terrible place to work ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"Managers try and trap you in one job. Don\xe2\x80\x99t promote growth or learning. Was hired for four tens but they mandated me every week for an extra twelve hours. They only see you as another body, nothing more. "
Amazon,1fl4bpe9jocrn800,3,Straight forward,Receiving Associate,"Job is pretty straight forward, repetitive, not creative, pays well, weekly, mostly on time, would\xe2\x80\x99ve stayed if my commute wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so long, it paid the bills"
Amazon,1fl4amii8osn4800,2,Randomly sent home at start of shift.,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,It is what you would expect of a warehouse job. But the biggest issue was they would randomly choose people to go home at the start of the shift. They would not tell anyone ahead of time. They wait until everyone is clocked in then they show a list of people that just don't get work that day with absolutely no compensation.
Amazon,1fl4aa9veu1l4800,5,Nice but not long term,Worker,"I enjoyed working at Amazon for 4 weeks, pay was good scheduling was flexible just a lot of heavy lifting and hard work consistently. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to do longterm"
Amazon,1fl4a5u92n5co800,5,Must Be flexible because thing change in seconds but very convient work from home job.,Virtual Customer Service Associate,"Worked here as a seasonal remote customer service representative. Everything was smooth from the equipment arriving in time for training. Customers can be rude, but it is expected if a package is not available. Be aware of phishing scams and other threatening customers. Other than that, take your time to assist customers who need support. I adjusted my schedule from 8-6 to 3-11 after the first month, so I could watch my son until his father got off. You can also swap shifts etc. I loved this company. I believe we received a couple of bonuses during the five months I was employed. The prizes were over 500, but I don't know if they always provide bonuses. We also were sent little small gifts. They do their best not to treat you like a number, but you are a number in their metrics. You do have goals you need to meet etc., but they provide so many resources, etc. What you learned- There are so many resources, and there are different websites in each country and what customers can purchase and view.Management- There are a lot of managers, but they do their best to assist.Workplace Culture- Amazonians are what takes place. They will share information and discuss different topics.The Hardest part of the job is when there are shipping issues, and customers cannot find what they need.The most enjoyable part of the job is working remotely and knowing how secure the system is. All calls are recorded even when you put your phone on mute. "
Amazon,1fl48fi7bosn4802,3,Horrible Scheduling ,Personal Shopper,"It\xe2\x80\x99s a good job, if you are just looking for a easy side job, in which you can pick your own shifts. I was part of the MTR flex and they never post enough shifts for everyone. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be lucky to get 20 hours even with working at other locations. Also there\xe2\x80\x99s no advancements or growth. They let you apply to job posting but even then it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get it. I will say that they have an awesome maternity leave for MTR flex. "
Amazon,1fl431bo4u1l4801,4,Work tasks are easily done few glitches ,Warehouse Associate,"The job is easy, fast paced, time goes by quickly. The team works mostly are millennial 's that know IT very well, ethics might need to be explained more. LOVED WORKING there."

Amazon,1fl35jok8n5co800,5,Pretty good,Stower/Order Picker Operator,You have to really understand the scale on how they operate they have a different system and you have to work within their system otherwise it won't be successful for you. It's a good place to learn many different things
Amazon,1fl35gssen5co801,4,Easy for part time employees ,Packer,Management is chill for the four hour shift people. It can get boring sometimes but they have speakers for music. Co workers are also very nice and chill.
Amazon,1fl2b8dpgosn4801,3,Complicated,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"at amazon you are expected to work as a ""team"" but in reality all that matters for the most part is your own personal rate. If your rate drops the managers would come by to check up on you. The lunch room was pretty crowded being quiet difficult to find a seat. The microwaves were usually all taken making so you would have to wait 5-10 min of your lunch waiting to reheat your food. But on the other if you use your time wisely you are able to leave work on tough days but the way it is run make you feel like a machine practically. You show up to work look at screen go to station rinse repeat. "
Amazon,1fl28klliu1l4802,3,Not something to put effort in to moving up,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"Managers do not take work seriously, will take advantage of you, If you know more than what your job description as a tier one says, you do not get a raise. Overall it is an alright area of work. but not sustainable forever."

Amazon,1fl1l4rj7n5co801,5,It was about quotas and the ability to do the job,Counter,Amazon was a great place to work. Love the people and supervision was not to bad. They train you and you work individually to to the job. It could be constant and repetitive but it was good. There were times where the tools needed to get the job done was not available and they found ways to move you around to still be productive. 
Amazon,1fl1h7hdjn59v802,4,Stable job with meh pay and meh work benefits,Warehouse Associate/Forklift Driver,"Working for Amazon is not the funnest job unless the co-workers are fun and cool people. Working for a fulfillment center can be somewhat boring after a while of being there. Overnight shifts will eat a person up. Overnight shifts are very mentally demanding because there is no room for work and life balance unless it's an off day. Working overnight sums up to waking up, going to work and repeating and it does eventually add up. However, if a person has no self love, they will endure these demands from Amazon and  receive a meh wage plus meh benefits. The most beneficial aspect of Amazon is that this job is stable and is not going anywhere. The job is good for people who like stability and repetitiveness."
Amazon,1fl1fmjvds7is800,3,it pays,Fulfillment Associate I,flexiblity is ok but they treat you like a number. its very solitary work unless you actually try to wanna make friends there. would suggest to ppl who want to find a job without an interview.
Amazon,1fl17b1r2o260802,3,Fast paced. ,Area Manager,"Stressful environment. A lot of coordination & responsibility that it almost felt like the pay wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth it. Ideally, I think this position should be used as a stepping stone for another job."

The human body isn\xe2\x80\x99t a machine, but they treat you like you\xe2\x80\x99re dispensable. Poor treatment, low pay, horrible work life balance. Run away fast as possible. "
Amazon,1fl0muardn5co801,1,Horrible ,Loader,They don't respect the schedule they give you. Constant over time despite plenty of downtime. Nothing is that important to sacrifice employees health despite them claiming to care about such things like suicide. The whole reason for being here is the 4 day work week because you have absolutely no life working 10 hour days. Working 5 or 6 days absolutely blows.  Holidays don't matter we had over time in October just an excuse to push more products people don't need. 
Amazon,1fl0lnvqhn59v802,2,Transportation associate ,Transportation Specialist,"Pretty much just drive hostler trucks as the new people have to be specifically trained to do that, and that always takes a long time to accomplish.  Working at Amazon had its benefits but you really are just a tiny spoke in a massive wheel.  All the mangers are either over educated know it alls or even worse former military who know it all.  You can't put your name on anything in your career at that company, and good luck trying to do that as a straight, white male. "
Amazon,1fl0cveh6u1l4802,3,A lot of overtime ,Picker/Stower,"It\xe2\x80\x99s ok to work there if you are wanting to work for a little bit and find something better. Depending on what department you are, they will have you work so much mandatory overtime and they will use you a lot."
Amazon,1fl06opdkt4vo802,4,Very diverse workplace with a lot of moving parts.  Thousands of people/jobs. Some tasks are extremely easy and others are more treacherous ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"The job is what you make it, although the 10 hour shifts are long!! The peak season Nov-Dec you'll be the busiest. Mandatory five day eleven hour shifts.  The work is repetitive in nature, if you like doing the same thing over and over Amazon would be a great fit."
Amazon,1fl033f28n5co800,5,Great bene's,Warehouse Associate,Full benefits from day 1 of employment.  Loooong shifts with 2 short breaks.Many times it's all about the numbers to management...and with that comes the stress to produce.
Amazon,1fkvt017iosn4802,3,Good pay,Fulfillment Associate,"Management plays favorites, but the pay and the benefits are good. Long hours but they are good with providing some time off options other than during the holidays when vacation is blacked out."
Amazon,1fkv4j0imn59v801,2,Fun workplace.,Problem Solver,"Is a very good experience, you always got training learn new skills Fun place, schedule and benefit is good but some manager like to abuse people who can't explain herself well in English."
Amazon,1fkv3agd9n59v801,3,"Disorganization, Long Hours, ok Pay",Dock Associate,"I work on the outbound dock for Amazon. The facility is relatively new so management is not very knowledgeable  in Amazon policy. Minorities are not respected here. I worked in another facility near Chicago and was very diverse and people got along well. Minorities had positions in management. Here, there is none of that.  Safety doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even know most of their responsibilities. "
Amazon,1fkuu2anmn59v800,2,Too many lies,Associate,"Don't believe them when they say you will get health insurance, that you get discounts, and that you get schooling paid for. You might get schooling paid for in some areas, but areas like mine you do not because there are no approved schools. Don't believe them when they say you will get more than 40 hrs a week. Sure, you are able to get 40 or more hrs a week sometimes but there are other times you will only get 12 to 15 hrs a week. For the last month and a half, I have not gotten more than 15 hrs. Then, you have people coming in after you that's making more than you and its for the same exact job you're doing. They constantly take your time and try finding reasons to fire you. No matter how many people complain about something if it gets changed, its only changed for the worse. Management is always trying to find ways to mess with you and make your job miserable. They will work their good workers to death while letting those who don't do anything just stand around. Its even worse when you become a PA and are running your own area because then you have not only the employees talking to you and treating you like garbage  but you have the Am's and OM's doing it as well... And for what? $1 more an HR which isn't worth it, That's why I quit that position and went back to the floor scanning. It may not be this way at all locations but MOB5 (mobile, AL) its this way. I hate going to work everyday. I will be so happy when I am done with school and can be done with the place. 3 years has already been too long. "
Amazon,1fkuhnvhbu1l4802,4,Love it,Sr. Staffing Coordinator,"Great flexibility , great benefits, some stations are driven by egos, favoritism, there\xe2\x80\x99s certainly privileged driven promotions. Culture varies by building. Benefits are awesome! "
Amazon,1fkucu7fho260801,4,Management and training need training ,Picker,"As a new employee, I was trained for 3 days. On day two we were supposed to learn the ins and outs of how to use the scanner. We literally sat there doing nothing for almost the entire 8 hours. The trainer kept asking if we had any questions, but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to ask because there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough information provided to have questions. Dim wit. Leadership say they want to \xe2\x80\x9cset us  up for success\xe2\x80\x9d but look annoyed when approached with a question. Training is sub par. Management has a lot to be desired. You\xe2\x80\x99re on own if you want to succeed. "
Amazon,1fktu2h6dt4vo800,4,Amazon is ok for what it is,Driver,"Could be better, but the jobs are easy. Only downside is that they are repetitive. Seems to be new people every day, High turn over. VTO is great tho."
Amazon,1fktth1qao260801,3,Overall okay ,Inbound Prep,"Helpful with my work/ home life. Pay is decent for what you do. If you work overnight you get paid a little more. Can sometimes get tedious, but there\xe2\x80\x99s always opportunities to move areas."

I'd much rather that they try to find another job that I could do. But they won't despite my repeated requests."
Amazon,1fktl76cvosn4802,1,"Decent pay & benefits, high turnover, policy changes frequently, managers not really helpful, HR is a mess",FC Associate,"(Pick department) You\xe2\x80\x99re trained for two days and then expected to know everything after that. A manager will come and speak to you at the beginning of the shift and disappear for the rest of day so good luck finding answers to problems related to your job. Managers have favorites on the shift so unless you\xe2\x80\x99re one of them you\xe2\x80\x99ll be standing in the same place for 10 hours. Moving up in the company is not possible unless you\xe2\x80\x99re favorite of a Level 4 or 5 manager. Policy changes every few months so it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to remember the changes made. Managers push for higher and higher expectations too fast. Stations are spaced out enough to where you can\xe2\x80\x99t have a conversation with a coworker so time goes by slowly. Becoming an ambassador is like a lead where you train new hires and perform audits and retrains but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come with any benefits, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be paid the same rate as what you started. The app you use to check your schedule and use your PTO is bugged most of the time. Breaks are short considered you have to walk 3-5 minutes to the break rooms. COVID-19 mandates 6 feet apart so one person allowed in the elevator at all times then you\xe2\x80\x99ll see a manager with 5 others coming out of the elevator. "
Amazon,1fkthhe84n5co800,3,Pretty alright for a warehouse environment,Associate,"Pretty alright for a warehouse environment, we just made shirts and hoodies/jackets. It was very repetitive other than not knowing what role you'd fill before your shift. "

Amazon,1fkt25j1docrn802,1,Feels like I’m in high school again. ,Packer/Sorter,"Management is worse than the employees. The PA\xe2\x80\x99S are the backup managers and does way more than the actual managers but receive less. The higher ups are just in it for the Vest , money and title. I do not feel secure here , VERY high turnover rate. We\xe2\x80\x99ve lost some outstanding workers due to the incompetence of the higher ups. They pick and choose when and what policies to follow. They all have their favorites and the rest of us are left in the dark to drown while still being yelled at , wrote up and/or terminated EVEN THOUGH we do more than their favorites. Also the higher ups here have NO CLUE how to do their jobs , many occasions where we have to explain to them how to do something they should already know how to do! (This isn\xe2\x80\x99t even half of it) but Amazon do better! "
Amazon,1fkt1m8b1n59v802,4,Good as a temporary job ,Warehouse Associate,Decent pay for single people. If you\xe2\x80\x99re looking to grow in your career good luck. Almost no work/life balance. Coworkers are all friendly and nice so it makes up for the long hours you will have to work. 
Amazon,1fkslsu3hu1l4801,2,Treated people like trash ,Warehouse Associate,I worked for this company during the pandemic and genuinely hated it. They treat people like trash but they treated the robots better. You got written up if you had to use the bathroom too many times in a day.. or if you had to refill your water bottle. It\xe2\x80\x99s insanely hot in there I ended up passing out from the heat on the floor I was on 
Amazon,1fksl0v59ocrn800,4,Hard work,Picker/Packer,The job was hard work and standing long hours. Breaks was not enough time- it was more time spent walking to the break room than time to actually take a break. 
Amazon,1fkska3tqocrn800,3,Honest work for honest pay,FC Associate I,"Working in a fulfillment center, I was treated like a number rather than a person most of the time. The work is simple enough, but the expectations for you are a little high.The pay is solid and the benefits are amazing from day 1."
Amazon,1fksgl32an5co800,3,Can be better,Personal Shopper,I work as a personal shopper and the job is interesting. The managers sometimes don't know what they are there to do. The system tells them what to do and it seems to me they feel redundant. This makes them look like a nuisance when they keep saying the same things over and over to the shoppers.
Amazon,1fkseobt4t4vo801,3,Its ok,Fulfillment Associate,Well i do flex so i choose the shifts that are available to me around the times i feel i\xe2\x80\x99m able to work. Overall its an ok job. Its a job! So you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna work. Honestly it isn\xe2\x80\x99t all that bad . They really need to fix management though. Pay is decent for the work you do.
Amazon,1fksb9a61n59v802,1,Just Don’t Do It ,Warehouse Associate,"The only time it\xe2\x80\x99s acceptable to work for Amazon is when you\xe2\x80\x99re actively working on a way to never have to work for Amazon again. You get lost in your own head at around the third hour of mind numbing, painfully unintelligent music blasted in the warehouse - if you\xe2\x80\x99re lucky enough to have music played by management. The rest time of your time is spent reflecting on all of your micro decisions and choices that led you up to stuffing a f*cking cubby with cardboard boxes for people who didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay nearly enough money to receive overnight shipping on the backs of employees who are severely underpaid, under appreciated and under rewarded to make it happen. "
Amazon,1fkrrlr91s7is802,2,Overworked,Amazon Warehouse Associate,Been at Amazon for two years only been there that long because I can\xe2\x80\x99t find anything else. We are not appreciated and we are overworked. Long hours take a toll on your body. Have no social life because all I want to do it sleep. 
Amazon,1fkqugi1vn59v800,1,Was hoping Amazon would be my Career...,Field Quality Assurance Manager,"Been with the company for over 3 years and could not be more disappointed. They demoted my position making it nearly impossible to advance from. Positions are categorized by levels (1, 2, 3, 4 and so on). They do not let you skip levels when promoting so when I was a level 4 and got demoted to Level 3, I cannot get promoted to level 5.  I am qualified and sometimes overqualified for level 5 positions, but get rejected for these jobs due to this. -They treat you like a number and you are always replaceable.-They micro manage you to the point that you hate your job.-The company is so big that nothing gets ""fixed"". Meaning they don\'t fix the issue, they work around it and just try to get by.I could go on and on, but I am extremely disappointed with Amazon. Was really hoping it would be my career job, but they do not care one bit about you."
Amazon,1fkqqcge6u1l4802,4,intern review,Intern,it was good but manager was not too supportive. work differs heavily by team and project for the same role as an intern. personally was not too interested in my team
Amazon,1fkqj0jfun59v800,1,Avoid working here unless you’re in dire need of money.,Picker,"Of the labor jobs I have worked it is by far the least physical. My job is as a picker so that will be where this review is coming from. Physically the job is easy but it is extremely mentally draining. I have almost zero interaction with coworkers throughout the day and this is not by choice. It\xe2\x80\x99s just you and your thoughts the entire time you are at work. I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked here for almost 6 months now and have still yet to meet my manager. If I were to pass away, not a single person at my job would even be aware. People I have met in passing have for the most part already quit. The job is putting me through school so I am thankful for that but it has also destroyed my mental health. I have no sense of purpose or belonging at work. My disdain for this job has made me refuse to buy anything from this company. I am not a lazy person by any means and have worked in a steel mill and at an airport painting airplanes. Both of these jobs were way more physical but there was a sense of comradery between coworkers. That does not exist here."
Amazon,1fkqh4bmds7is802,3,Long hours,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Good company to work for great benefits. It is hard work and long hours. Need to improve their training and not expect you to know everything your first week.

Amazon,1fkqfv1q9o260802,2,People are constantly in pain,Inbound Stower,"The work ethics at Amazon is work harder, work faster, and stretch. Literally you can not work fast enough to make your bosses happy, they are never happy unless you are working at a pace that destroys your body.

Amazon,1fkqe9j3qs7is802,4, Warehouse ,Warehouse Associate,Very interesting place to work . Depends on management some are cool some aren\xe2\x80\x99t . Your in your own space at work. Simple task easy to move up in company .

Amazon,1fkq7hr3hn59v800,2,high intensity stressful environment,Associate,the work there was extremely stressful and had an extreme intensity all of the time. managers seemed to only care about numbers and nobody seemed to care on a personal level about others feelings or needs in the workplace. they compensate fairly for the work that is expected but are extremely intolerant to any deviation from the norm. they also have a extremely strong Anti-Union environment from the upper management and want to stop union talk at every turn.
Amazon,1fkq0nocau1l4800,5,Fun place to work ,Employee,Worked at delivery station. Met a lot of cool people. Honestly loved my job so much. Work out first half of the day then I debriefed drivers towards the end of my shift . Wish I never left 
Amazon,1fkpvj6tcn5co800,5,Great company - Tough culture,"Operations Manager, North American Fulfillment Centers","I worked for Amazon for 2 years and it was rather rewarding. With that said, they did not treat there leadership team the same way they treat their team members. Expectations where high and it was made known to everyone when you did not hit them.

Amazon,1fkosiof1o1ci800,5,Amazing place to work,Picker/Packer/Shipper,I absolutely loved working at Amazon. The pay was amazing. As well as all of my coworkers and my manager. I loved the hours. I will forever love working at Amazon.

Amazon,1fkolr7pan522800,5,Loved it!!,Fulfillment Associate,There was a LOT of walking but it was fun and energizing. They always did extra giveaways or fun things for employees especially during peak season. Pays well but hours are long so not much work/family balance. Easy job though for the pay.
Amazon,1fkohusuet5fb800,1,Awful,Picker/Packer,Awful company to work for. They don\xe2\x80\x99t care about anything besides \xe2\x80\x9ctime.\xe2\x80\x9d Good forbid you have to go to the restroom you\xe2\x80\x99ll be time for that. Ridiculous 
Amazon,1fkodilpfu20t802,3,"Easy job, no mobility ",Warehouse Associate,"Low pay for easy work. Lots of benefits and resources available. However no room to move up internally really. The whole structure of the company is a joke. Overall, there are much better jobs out there"

Amazon,1fko7uhgc269p000,3,Na,Warehouse Worker,Everyone was nice a good way to make quick cash they offer great benefits and like the fact that we only work 4 days. But the labor is hard so be ready to stand
Amazon,1fko5qavot4fe802,2,Difficult place to work,Picker/Packer,"The hardest part of working as a picker was keeping up the pace, which I couldn't do. To be fair, the process assistants did try to work with me and give me tips for how to work faster. However, I ended up getting written up so many times that I eventually left before they could fire me. "
Amazon,1fko5luaf269p002,3,Boring,Warehouse Associate,You don't have to have any skills. Stand for 12 hours (if that's the shift you choose) they sometimes run out of work and you just stand around until more comes
Amazon,1fko0daehu1hp802,3,Easy work but repetitive and labor intensive,Warehouse Associate,You will be sore! Great hours and benefits but inhumane rules and productivity expectations. High turnover rate as well. In the end it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth the pay for me.
Amazon,1fknuc5ahu1hp800,4,"Decent pay, but non stop tedious labor",Associate,"I worked the night shift at the CLE2 Amazon fulfillment center as part of the inbound stow department. The people there were nice, and I lucked out by having an awesome manager. The job was not too difficult, but incredibly mindless, and was constant work as you had to meet minimum stow rates. The worst part were the mandatory extra time days, which they would tell you about in as little as 24 hours in advance. No upward mobility, but good as a temporary way to make money."
Amazon,1fknrk9geu1hp802,3,Easy but boring,Warehouse Associate,"Easy, boring, pays okay, opportunity to advance exists but the school program is trash. Very repetitive works, will be absolutely mind numbing but time off options are great."

Amazon,1fknqhnh5269p000,1,Lot of lazy bones,Associate,Management and coworkers will watch you do the hardest position for the entire shift as they relax and watch you bust your butt.  Hard work with people taking advantage and HR nowhere to be found.  
Amazon,1fknn561fu1hp801,2,HR experience at Amazon won't be applicable anywhere else,Sr. HR Assistant,"I've worked in Amazon HR for about 1.5 years now. Your experience as an Amazon employee will vary from location to location, site to site and team to team. Each FC runs like an individual business. The first team i worked on as a sr. HRA was a bunch of college graduates and never have i experienced such a lack of professionalism and sound judgement. Management at some locations are better than others. Some FC's run smoother and adhere to policies differently for better or worse. Working in HR at amazon will not be useful anywhere else for your career .Amazon is very policy driven and all policies are extremely specific to Amazon's goals and culture. I honestly can't even explain to someone who doesn't work at amazon what i do all day because it makes no sense. Rarely are productive changes made to policies either. Leadership asks for feedback and barriers and then does nothing about it when you are open and honest. Certain changes happen way too fast and others way too slow. typically any associate impacting changes happen too fast and then HR is stuck cleaning up the mess and reiterating the changes a million times bc the communications team did a poor job. Very little perks, pay is not competitive. Sr. HRA's are supposed to come in with a college degree and HR expereince and then get stuck fixing timecards all day. Oh and my annual raise was .20 cents."

I looked forward to coming to work because there was always something new and the co-workers were pretty nice. After two or so years the atmosphere pretty much went downhill. They started to focus too much on the numbers and there's little to no work life balance, and not much room for flexibility. Amazon may have tried hitting the mark with customer service, but fails when it comes to the treatment of their employees. Nowadays you feel like a number and replaceable. "
Amazon,1fkmmv7teu1hp802,3,Could be better,Driver,"It\xe2\x80\x99s a good job for what it pays. After awhile, dealing with the different weather conditions such as sweating to death in summer or freezing numb in the winter, can really take its toll. It\xe2\x80\x99s good exercise, but the uncertainty of not knowing when you\xe2\x80\x99ll be done for the day can be a put off. You will have to rescue other drivers sometimes and take some of their load if they\xe2\x80\x99re being too slow and I just dont like the feeling of finishing someone else\xe2\x80\x99s route if they\xe2\x80\x99re just as capable as me."

I was a seasonal employee at 2 of them and full time at the other. I liked that as a seasonal part-time employee I was able to choose when I worked and how often, but when I was a full time employee I got very overwhelmed. It's definitely hard work a lot of the time and working a 10 hr shift overnight took a toll. Management was chill for the most part and most of my coworkers were cool. Some of the productivity goals were a bit unrealistic and led to people getting stressed easy. Overall its an okay place to work if you're in desperate need for a full time job, but I wouldn't work there again. "
Amazon,1fkm414c2sa8i800,1,Easy to get hired and find a fitting schedule,Warehouse Associate/Staffing Administrator/AMXL FC Associate,"Amazon makes it pretty easy to find a shift and location that fit my job search criteria.  And they offer great pay and benefits right off your hiring date.  Depending on which type of Amazon warehouse you apply to, your typical day will be very different.  I worked at a delivery station aka the last mile.  We sorted packages overnight into bags.  In the morning the bags are loaded into vans.  Then, I worked at one of the AMXL Fulfilment centers which required heavy lifting and palletizing freight inventory.  This role involved using PIT machines like Forklifts and Order Pickers.  I also worked on their field recruiting team.  This role required travelling around and carrying loads of supplies for job fairs and walk-ins.  Amazon has lots of opportunities, and opportunity is what you make it.  But I warn you not to work to hard."

Amazon,1fklokdrau2f6801,1,"No matter how desperate you get, don't. ",Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"I worked here for maybe 3 weeks. The conditions are about what you'd expect for a warehouse, except they play one radio station with 20 songs every single night as loudly as possible. You're told to request help for 50+lbs packages and then given no way to do so- and if you stop for even a moment you get in trouble. So basically you're lifting that 50+lbs package alone. Count on agonising back pain, long hours, extremely strict breaks, and a complete lack of care from supervisors. I'm so glad I quit. "

Amazon,1fklj7tc9t4u8802,3,Neither the managers nor the company care about you,Learning Ambassador,The managers will literally not help out in a lot of situations. The scheduling of managers is stupid and they frick up a lot of people's schedules. The company doesn't care if they cut you loose. You could end up working by yourself on a lane with tons of boxes and no one cares. It's a pretty toxic environment. Breaks are only 15 minutes at my facility. Would not recommend working here unless you're desperate or need some gas money. It's not worth it. The managers treat you horribly. They don't care about anyone but themselves. There's also no paid time off for most or all warehouses.
Amazon,1fklgn2mrnpu2802,5,Great for College students ,Fresh Associate,"I worked part time flex in Amazon Fresh which was okay but it gets repetitive and annoying very quickly. There were 4 zones, ambient, frozen, chilled, and produce. They constantly put me and newer people in the freezer but those that had worked there longer always did one job constantly which was quite unfair. In my location specifically there was often little to no work, so you got sent to do blind cycle counts which is basically counting every item in the bin and checking for expiration. Picking in ambient was the worst because it is constantly super hot in the building and there\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely no AC or any way to cool down. The only pro I saw was that I could choose when and what day I worked which is the only reason I stayed for so long. I may transfer or quit if my transfer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go through. "

Amazon,1fkla5072t4u8802,5,Great Place to Work!!,Virtual Customer Service Representative,"I worked Amazon seasonal customer service twice.  Training was great both times but short the 2nd time; only two weeks.  First week was nothing but chat customers. Then call in and chat, then mostly call in.  Team support was great.  Intra-departmental support was iffy.  Time off is flexible and you can always do a team leader approved shift swap, if needed.  Both times I had to leave because of my mother's health issues.  Trying to get a remote job now post-Covid is difficult and not just at Amazon.  If you can handle in-person irate customers, you can handle Amazon remote customer service.   "
Amazon,1fkl9jns6nq2g802,3,"Good pay, good option to have",Fulfillment Associate,"It's a good job to fall back on and not be homeless. The pay rate is good. The rate being difficult and stressful as well as peak season and forced over time aren't for everyone. People that have stuck through it have advanced from what I've seen but still difficult. If you have nothing else or need money not a bad place, plus benefits. With the turnover rate and pay rate you are very much expendable."

Sometimes there\xe2\x80\x99s someone at that station when you get there so you have to go back and get a new station number. A lot of walking and standing during the day and no where to sit until you have your break or go to lunch.

Amazon,1fkima3aeu3hf802,2,Do not trust this position ,Learning Ambassador,"Amazon is a great place to work if you need a job and that's about all I can say about that. The position is not secure (our warehouse cut the entire shift with less than a weeks notice) despite what they have told you (they told us we were converted to permanent).There is a high turnover due to the conditions and workstyle that amazon demands. The stories about Amazon drivers peeing in bottles is true and you will find them in trucks or bags that have been returned. There are positives in that the pay is higher than most minimum wage jobs. The health insurance is certainly better than you will get elsewhere, even though you may not be able to use it unless you have been there 30 days. They are also usually hiring. All I am saying here is that you should know the situation you are getting into. Know that unless you are made blue badge immediately, you should not trust that they will make you one. The conditions are hectic but it is a warehouse job after all. Be cautious"

Amazon,1fkgkjcint4de802,1,ehh,Warehouse Associate,"so the benefits are awesome but that\xe2\x80\x99s about it. pay is okay could be better, and the hours and good. 40 a week. but actually working there is horrible. coworkers are rude and unhelpful. management is okay but can be very rude most times. the breaks you get just don\xe2\x80\x99t cut it. you barely have enough time to eat lunch or even sit down for 10 minutes. i don\xe2\x80\x99t recommend.

Some employees game the system- take naps in their cars, disappear for long stretches if in indirect roles and that makes it unfair for the workers who are actually working hard. Accountability is sham. Favorites get better placement in roles and depts. Promoting from within is rare. Many younger employees are entitled and the younger the better because they\xe2\x80\x99ll throw gimmicks their way to appease them for a while. Good luck if you\xe2\x80\x99re a female because it\xe2\x80\x99s unrealistic, and comes with the male jokes, biased workload and advanced goals. Some at the company are wonderful people, just not enough to make it work long term. Turnover is a revolving door for a reason.  You can be sent to other shifts in a snap-doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if it works for your family balance. A fake environment that works hard to act like they are doing good works and care about their employees  (So many commercials about their self promotion of supporting greater good\xe2\x80\x94lol).  It\xe2\x80\x99s all about one-upping each other and each facilities\xe2\x80\x99 metrics. Numbers over people, all in the name of caring for the customer.

Supervisors and Leaders were very professional had a very good Covid-19 awareness. Work kept us busy. The only thing negative was the VTO (voluntary time off). They would ask us who would like to voluntarily go home early. This doesn't count against your attendance though. And this didn't happen unless we didn't have enough work due to trucks not coming in. Because of a snow storm or something.

Besides that, I don't have anything negative to say about Amazon, they take care of you pretty well there, the pay and benefits are good, the schedules are fairly flexible. I would rather in eight hour shift five days a week, but they do 10-hour shifts there which sets you up for a three day weekend. Amazon tries very hard to have a good culture there, but ultimately you will not find a sense of purpose, or teamwork or anything like that here, the job doesn't do that. Most of the positions where I worked in warehouse deals had a rate quota that you had to meet, within the first two weeks they want you to be around 80 or 90% and within the first month you need to be getting near 100%. After the task is learned I found the rate to be reasonable for most of the tasks they ask you to do. There are also light physical positions at Amazon where you move totes around and use a pallet jack, those positions don't have a rate. Oh, they also give you pretty good leave, they give you a drop when you first start of leave, then you accrue some each week, you don't have to ask your manager to approve leave, it's automatically approved by the system and you can use it same day oh, so if you're 9 hours into your 10 hour shift and you can't hack it anymore you can log into your Amazon app and tell them you're going home and apply your leave and you just tell your boss you're out for the day, nice."

Amazon,1fkcmnl0ru3lr802,3,"Pay is great, but experience has definitely gone down.",Warehouse Worker,"I used to work at an amazon warehouse in FL, where the pay was a little worst but the job was great. The Pendergrass, GA warehouse is the opposite. While the pay is amazing, and I can get a full paycheck after working only 25 hours a week that I would get at another job working 40 hours, this warehouse does not feel inclusive towards its employees as my previous warehouse did."
Amazon,1fkclvb7ko2eu800,1,Not worth it.,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"Whatever position you apply for is likely not where you\'ll be,  they\'ll put you wherever the heck they want you!And if they put you on Dock.   GET OUT!!!!!The pay is not worth the workload you\'ll do on a weekly basis, extremely stressful, unorganized, very boring, the people there are miserable... but with the job its pretty self explanatory. Management is terrible they do not care about you! Employees do not matter here!!! You are trash. The boxes and the product are priority and are far more valuable then you are is the vibe I\'d get.     No training, training straight up sucks...nobody really knows what there doing.You just kinda go with the flow do the job hope you do it right, if not.... Sucks to suck.There is no promotion, really a dead end job! The most rewarding part is the end of the day and the 3 day break. That is if they dont schedule a ""mandatory extra time day""  Tell your friends to stay away!!!  Refer & Encourage your enemies to work here if anything.**Trust me there are far better opportunities out there then this ish, Goodluck!"

Amazon,1fkbtq1hot4cg800,1,All about the numbers here not the people ,FC Support,"Can\'t speak for all but worked at 2 different locations (sort center & Fulfillment center) wish I\'d never left the first. Most  managers were horrible busy gossiping, not out to help you advance or learn new areas and the few that weren\'t quicky left or transfered someplace else. They are all about the #\'s could care less about you (the person who\'s making things happen). Expect you to keep a fast pace for 10 hours. So pace yourself because however many you do is expected of you each day. Push you to bring it higher. Also watch out for loss prevention people they can\'t do they\'re job properly either and under pressure. They have to account for missing items that sometimes end up busted,  trashed smashed etc..and if its not pulled from system loss prevention job is to give answers as to where it went. While there I seen many people accused and let go without proof for stealing. Loss prevention said ""they had job to do as well and someone has to account for those items"" or they\'d be out of a job also..cut throat place where nice to your face but don\'t turn your back!!!"

Filled with creativity, culture, and so much support. I felt like there was so much room for career growth/development. Here we are 3 years and one week, exactly, later. It\xe2\x80\x99s gotten so bad to the point where team managers who have been there for years, don\xe2\x80\x99t like the direction the company (site) is going and has quit. Which ultimately lead to my team getting an extreme micromanager. Over the course of the past 3 weeks, her management style has caused 5 people to quit and about 6 more currently looking for other jobs. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been there for 3 years and I JUST seen a raise in my paycheck. I\xe2\x80\x99m in the same spot I was when I started. No one cares about you, every man for themselves.

I learned how to stow, stage, pick and handle groceries in general. The hardest part of this job would be the amount of walking. No lie you are on your feet the WHOLE time besides break. What I do not like is some of the managers. I feel like sometimes they have favorites. They sometimes talk to me with an attitude in front of other employees. Some managers make me feel welcomed and some just make me not want to come to work enjoy packing groceries though. A manager got mad at me for not stowing enough groceries. It was my 2nd time doing inbound."
Amazon,1fk9b0r0eu3l6800,3,Hard work. Unfair. A good fit for some.,Warehouse Associate,It is hard work for a small pay increase over other unskilled jobs. My manager appeared to allocate work based on race and gender. If you work hard you will be given more work. Everyone is paid the same regardless of effort. A good job if you are a small woman or disabled as you will be given the easy work. Safety training by official safety trainers is excellent. Though they move you around so much that you will not be prepared for new safety challenges. The hardest part of the job is psychologically dealing with discrimination. The best part of the job is working with your peers and not having to serve rude customers.

Amazon,1fk8loab2o2bv800,5,SO many great things,Warehouse Associate,"Pros:- Easy to get a job. If you're in a bad situation and need an income, Amazon will most likely hire you and you will have a job in no time.- Benefits are great. Benefits are only good if you take advantage of them, but they are cheap and offer extensive coverage. Now is the time to go to the dentist, get some new glasses, fix whatever condition you may have. They even cover massages/chiropractor/acupuncture visits as well.- The work is mostly easy. It's not customer facing and you don't have to worry about dress code/hair too much. It's not back breaking, but some jobs may give you discomfort whereas they won't hurt other people. Amazon is good about helping you find the right job for you.- Amazon offers upskilling programs to employees who make it past 90 days of employment. They will cover the cost for you to earn a 2 year degree at a local school in your area. Various learning paths offered like Software Developer, Dental Hygienist, Truck Driver, Nursing and more... - It is definitely possible to move up. A few of my operations managers started out as tier 1's. They are nice people who just put in the hard work and rose to challenges that came their way. They aren't super hero's, anyone can do it if they apply themselves I believe. There are also other positions to obtain like positions in teaching others (learning), transportation yard, robotics engineering, manager assistants (process assistants), IT, and more... which can be obtained through showing an interest and asking how to get promoted.Cons:- "

Amazon,1fk80fha531id000,4,Decent job for those looking for part-time work,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"I worked at the HOU1 Amazon Sorting Center. Hours were very consistent and overtime hours were very abundant if you chose to work them. Job is very fast paced and requires a lot of physical activity. The job itself consisted of unloading packages from a conveyor belt and scanning them onto the appropriately labelled pallets. You had to make sure that each pallet was safely and properly arranged. The work can get repetitive at times, but it was a nice way to get some exercise throughout the day. You can also cross-train to different roles if you are willing to. Lunch breaks were very short and management is very strict about it. Most of the employees there were very nice and willing to help if I asked for it. Management had their obvious favorites and can sometimes be very strict, but it wasn't much of a problem overall. "
Amazon,1fk8001meu3mm801,5,Decent for the pay,TDR,"Can be fast paced but often times it is slow. Expected to scan packages, load and unload trucks, or move gaylords or carts around the building using pallet jacks. For the pay it isn\xe2\x80\x99t too bad. "

Amazon,1fk7m692fu3mm801,4,Opportunity to lear multiple departments,Warhouse Associate,Job can be repetitive however there are many different departments in which you can cross train.

Amazon,1fk7ji0h0o2eu802,3,Both A Easy and Hard Job With Some Career Progression,Warehouse Associate,"I have worked at Amazon for over two years as a full-time, part-time employee warehouse associate. While the job may be hard at first, after about 2-weeks to a month, it becomes repetitive and easy. I had learned to drive a PIT after a month since starting and problem solved 6 months in (since then I have hit a plateau due to my part-time hours of work with college). My body has somewhat gotten used to the work, but I still feel exhaustion once I get home and wake up, but not to the point of being painful. There are both short and long-term career aspects at Amazon, particularly on the warehouse side, but the culture and management of the company turns many people off resulting in extremely high turnover. Of the 6 people that were with me on Day 1, I am the only one remaining as the others quit 3-6 months in. There is a lot of apathy and toxicity in general. The culture of Amazon does not support retention of good employees as most people (including management) will leave/transfer out within 1-6 months in. Those that do stay will often have those traits mentioned above (this breeds even more toxicity as numbers are the #1 priority to management). To add on, external hires are paid much more for the upper positions as they are perceived to have not stagnated and can provide a fresh set of eyes to improve the cog wheels per se (more often than not their ideas are to the detriment of the lower-tiered workers). To Amazon this is normal, as one of their mottos is \xe2\x80\x9cdevelop the best\xe2\x80\x9d. I feel sorry for my full-time employees who have to work 40+ hours a week w/ mandatory overtime (20"

Amazon,1fk46usgho2eu800,1,Over worked at the beginning of covid,Learning Ambassador,This job was intense. I quickly moved up to doing other things which was nice not be labor tracked. It was hot in the warehouse. It's hard having real life issues because you can't just call out.
Amazon,1fk46d4e5u3mm802,1,Nightmare,Warehouse Associate,"What a terrible job. It's literally the worst job I ever had, you'll work harder than you ecer have in your entire life. They want you to put away 379 packages an hour, which is INSANE."
Amazon,1fk43l9cqu3l6800,2,Terrible place to work ,Electrical Engineer,Poor management. Leaders lack vision. Managers lack experience and skills. Multiple unnecessary approvals to get the job done. Too much politics exist. It's difficult for skilled employee to get promoted while employees who do not have engineering degree and lack skills get promoted as employees without engineering degrees are hired as senior and principal engineers.
Amazon,1fk43jhg3u3mm802,3,Only if you need quick money,Packer,"The money and benefits were decent but  I HATED working there. You are not respected as a person at all, simply a means to an end. No matter how hard you work, shatter records, give them everything you've got, it doesn't matter. You're expendable at a moments notice. I had an emergency surgery and, after I returned to work, I told them that I couldn't lift the heavier items. My paperwork had been submitted weeks before and I was waiting for accomodations to approve me for lighter duty. My manager didn't care and my incision started to tear back open..which sent me back to the er to have my lower abdomen closed back up. If you just need quick money, fine. If you're looking for a career and growth, and appreciation, Amazon is NOT it."
Amazon,1fk43c3rpo2eu800,3,Long and boring but great pay,Picker/Packer,When I worked with Amazon the pay was great but the job has little room for advancement and your treated like a number.

Amazon,1fk42e8l7u3l6800,1,"Huge employee turnover, very unorganized, very frustrqting",Associate,"One would think that Amazon would have everything together, organized, and streamlined . . . yeah ABSOLUTELY NOT the case at all.  Very unorganized and huge huge huge employee turnover. Never enough associates scheduled to be completely staffed (which is a safety violation but no one cares) and get the shift volume done. Managers all have their own styles of managing - so no continuity exists, and are bullied by upper management to get the job done no matter what, however they hardly ever jump in and assist when needed. They also say they are employee centric . . . not at all, they are profit centric."
Amazon,1fk3vg78ou3lr800,1,Great opportunity but poor management  ,Data Center Electrical Field Engineer,"Great opportunity but poor management, and always everyone is racing to promotion. If you are starting of your career, choose small companies to gain new skils rather than big tech"

Definitely wasn't hanging around for peak season.Not enough people for volume, co-workers make your job harder, only reward for working fast is getting more work, at minimum 5 managers taking their laptops for walks and tracking metrics instead of helping, "
Amazon,1fk3e0594o2eu802,2,Benefits are decent but overall not worth it.,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Upper management simply doesn't listen. They dont allow you to earn enough personal time off nor vacation. Raises aren't close to fair. They just care about people showing up. You are nothing but a number at Amazon.
Amazon,1fk3d6emqo2eu800,3,You have to work hard,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Prepare to work the hardest. There are no recognition of doing a good job. Management are scared of employees that do very little & complain the most.

Amazon,1fk372ve631id000,2,Stressful and fastpaced,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"Fast paced, stressful work environment with erratic management. Half hearted training putting new hires on the floor as soon as possble because they are consistently undermanned. A higher than average amount of favoritism, rewarding one's hard work with more work. The hard workers pick up the slack of the lazy workers. A lot horseplay among younger employees with hidden discrimination towards older employees while management turns a blind eye to it. Company works one to the bone and asks for more. Time off is needed in order to recover from the workloads, so not enough vitality to maximize off work time.15 minute breaks are actually 10 minutes because they count your time as you get to get to the break room to snack and rehydrate."
Amazon,1fk34faoru3l6801,5,Great place to work at but need a better pay,Warehouse Worker,It\xe2\x80\x99s all great n all this year there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a lot of work worked here for a little over a year quiet at my place not so for others so it all depends on the facility u work at
Amazon,1fk32ubd7u3l6802,2,Work is work ,Packer,The pay is what kept me going for the limited time I worked there. The managers gave little help when it came to explaining the job as you are expected to mainly learn from the computer screen in front of you and focused on reaching the goal. Very uncomfortable work conditions as it would be very hot or cold and the bathrooms are few and very far apart. It felt as being looking down on if you are not reaching their set goals after your first week there while being watched 24/7 for any slip ups that could get you terminated. 
Amazon,1fk2t2g6dt52e801,2,Amazon was a wild ride,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"Was working for Amazon for 12 months. It started off okay and then things went downhill.  The work I was able to do and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t complain about it. The work and the pay along with time off options has to be the only good things about working here. The environment, however, is toxic. There is a lot of favoritism that goes on between associates and managers since the majority of them know each other outside of Amazon. Also it could be that they speak the same language. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen many associates get learning or safety vests just simply because they know managers or PAs or speak the same language as them, and a lot of those associates were either lazy or new. You simply just cannot get any recognition for your work if ur not close with anybody. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here for 12 months and still have not gotten a learning or safety vest. The amount of disrespect I\xe2\x80\x99ve had while working here is crazy. On top of not getting recognition for my work, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had managers ask me three times if I was new here. These are the same people who I\xe2\x80\x99ve had face to face conversations with so that really felt like a slap in my face that I\xe2\x80\x99m basically invisible to them. Certain PAs have really bad and nasty attitudes, and it\xe2\x80\x99s gotten to a point where I changed schedules so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to work with them. Breaks are the worst. We are given 15 minute breaks, but they really feel shorter than that. It takes about 10 minutes to get to our break rooms and get our food and sit down. By that time we only have about 5 minutes left, and usually some managers will come to the break rooms before break is over and tell us to"
Amazon,1fk2qr9q8u3lr800,5,"Fast ,fun ,growth",Palletizer,Good place to work . Team work environment. Nice people . If you need to see HR . they are there onsite but after work hours or before.  Clean and organize environment

Amazon,1fk2kgc4pu3lr802,3,Just not for me,Sortation Associate,"I was a sortation associate. It was alright but I would not suggest it anyone who has trouble standing for long period of time. Great workout, but could definitely run someone down."
Amazon,1fk2ga6mhu3mm801,1,Go into the warehouse and you’ll see everyone limping ,Grunt worker,Amazon pushes you to your breaking point. Takes 10 min to get to the break room and ten minutes to go back so you only have a 10 min break. Your break should start when you get to the break room. Also during covid they would yell 6 ft but you literally have no walk space

Amazon,1fk2doqj6u3l6802,4,Great place to work,Warehouse Associate/ Temp,Great pay and benefits.  Four day work week gives you more time off. Even when their is no work you are still given 40 hours. It has all the benefits of being union without the hassle or fees of a union.  Clean and climate controlled work environment.  advancement opportunities are  social driven and not based on performance or familiarity with a particular process.  High turnover in managers . 
Amazon,1fk2d1pm9t52e800,5,Great opportunity but will need your soul for them ,HR Assistant,"Amazon has plenty of growth opportunities, however be prepared to sell your soul and life for them. Amazon does not provide a healthy work:life balance. The pay is great, but what\xe2\x80\x99s the point if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have time to enjoy the fruits of your labor. "
Amazon,1fk2826d0u3mm801,3,Its as hard as you make it.,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,I was in packing and the job itself was only as difficult as you made it for yourself. I learned day one don't depend on others to leave the station ready for you. Show initiative and get in a few minutes early and get yourself ready for the day. But don't get so worried about the station that you work on it before clocking in. 
Amazon,1fk221547o2eu802,5,Great Place to Work,Warehouse Associate,Great Company to work for. There is one thing anyone should know that the delivery station is a hard and physical job! Make sure you are on great shape before you take this job. Other than that I can see why Amazon is such a big thing as they fully take care of their employees! 
Amazon,1fk1p220lu3mm801,5,The job,Warehouse Associate,Serves its purpose it\xe2\x80\x99s really up too you how much or little you want to work do your job and you will be fine you go in there playing around they\xe2\x80\x99ll fire you simply put.
Amazon,1fk1otjdau3mm801,1,Dont waste your time. ,Warehouse Associate,"Management are not knowledgeable enough when you ask them a question, it\'s most of the time ""I don\'t know"". When using your PTO (personal time off/paid time off) they say you can use it whenever you want and it\'s approved instantly, which it is, but when you use it and if you do it frequently, they end up firing you, which doesn\'t make any sense. Overall it\'s a terrible place to work at and they wonder why people leave and they lose employees. They now have to use commercials on TV and offer $3K in sign on bonuses in order to get people to apply and come work... oh but when you do apply or reapply they turn you down, especially if you\'re a former employee. I give Amazon -10 stars. "

If you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for an easy job, amazon\xe2\x80\x99s great, and they promote within. If you value other things in life besides work, maybe keep scrolling. "
Amazon,1fk1bp99bu3mm800,2,Lots of Opportunities to Work Hard,Sr. Product Manager,"PROS- As a Sr. Product Manager and new MBA grad I gained invaluable experience SUPER quickly. Truly think this is the best place to learn to be a product manager.- Ability to grow and move around the company is relatively easy. Typical to go and pursue a new team after 18-24 months.- People have dogs in the officeCONS- Burnout is real- I was re-orged multiple time in one year and went through 5 managers over the course of 6 months- Compensation for good performance is non-existence. Despite having an above average review, my compensation and salary did not change at all because the stock of Amazon had performed above predicted priceI used Amazon as a way to pad my resume and it worked tremendously. So far, I have had job offers from all 5 other companies I have applied to and most of that being attributed to my experience at Amazon."
Amazon,1fk1bk35s31id000,3,you have to be very physically fit to work at Amazon,Amazon Associate,They care little about you and do not treat you as an individual. You are part of a team and can be easily replaced. They do not pay a living wage and do not encourage internal hire. You work hard to keep your rank high and they work you even harder to fake numbers for lower-ranking employees. If you don't think about it and are just there to gain a paycheck this job is for you because the pay and benefits aren't bad.

Amazon,1fk106upghihn800,1,"Productive but stressful without enough training,  and communication",Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Warehouse is very strict but I don't like how we manage products in respectful matters and it strictly to focus on your work and not have fun with it. The completion is over rated and the company doesn't appreciate us people doing what we can to make the company feel good and better for us as Associates of Amazon.
Amazon,1fk0rn6irnq0m800,3,Warehouse,Sortation Associate,For what it is I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x99s too bad. It\xe2\x80\x99s not very enjoyable work but it will pay the bills. I had a decent time working at Amazon. I just kept myself and did my own thing. Can\xe2\x80\x99t really complain for what it was. 
Amazon,1fk0naeopu53k801,2,Its an ok spot but can be a bit draining,Amazon Warehouse Member,"Normal day at work can be a bit monotonous and dull after you've been there for a while, and sometimes too much is demanded of you. Edit: Its been a year since ive worked here and in hindsight while it was difficult it isnt the worst job out there.

Amazon,1fk0didhat54k800,3,It was bad,Area Manager,"It was a really tough job. But the toughest part was seeing the associates, and what they had to go through. Their jobs are miserable, and it's hard to place difficult expectations on them when you know how messed up the whole system is."
Amazon,1fk0d0emuu53k802,1, physically challenging work,Dock Worker,"Well, honestly I feel like they get more work out of you than what they're paying you. In 12 hours of shift they give you a total break of 1 hour. they get a full work out of you and maybe more, they'll treat you as like machines and not humans and expect you to meet all the goals. "
Amazon,1fk09ud56t54q801,1,"Dont be scammed, believe the rumors",Warehouse Associate,"The rumors are true, limited bathroom breaks, long walks to clock out ect. When your undervalued they will show you on the first day, if you work, dont make it a long term thing."
Amazon,1fk05m0reu53k802,1,"Shifts that you apply for while a new hire, should still be available if you're chosen to be hired.",Fulfillment Associate,"I applied for the flex shift schedule with Amazon, because I am a college student. The flex schedule works best with my school schedule as I can choose when I want to work. After being accepted as a new hire I was instructed to pick my start date and shift. When picking my start date and shift I noticed that the flexible schedule was no where to be found. After contacting Amazon support I was told that all of a sudden the flexible schedules are no longer available and I'm not classified as a Flex employee. Garbage practice and not a great start to working at Amazon."
Amazon,1fk0519p3u53k801,5,Fast paced work environment,Warehouse Sortation Associate,At Amazon you can expect to work hard. It is a physical job. Management is treats you good at my facility. Great place for a college student and for people who thrive with physical work. Expect to be able to stand the entire shift and temperatures inside warehouse can get pretty hot in summer and cold in winter. Room for advancement if you are motivated and can catch the jobs available.  
Amazon,1fk027mk9u53l800,1,It sucks working at Amazon. Don't do it!,Customer Returns Processor,"First off Amazon is unflexible on anything. I worked in Phoenix Arizona, I quit and then started working for Amazon in Lexington Kentucky. They stopped giving me any paid time off even though there were six months unemployment gap between the two. They said that I used all of my paid time off for the entire year in January February and March of 2021 so I wasn't allowed to get any more for the year"
Amazon,1fk027hmft5l4801,1,Unfair expectations,Warehouse Associate,They work you to death and place higher and higher unrealistic work standards the next day after you've already met those goals.

Amazon,1fjvkkqnlt54q802,1,"Something isn’t right but is it CLT4 warehouse senior management, Amazon, or both? ",Warehouse Associate,"The unfair targeting of employees based on randomly assigned shift code at CLT 4 has left me in shock of how unfair and incompetent some senior level managers can be. Ex. All full time Sunday-Wednesday night employees are assigned 3 shift codes based on their mandatory overtime day being Thursday Friday or Saturday. Besides having 1/3 of the year with forced 55 hour work weeks at Charlotte 4 location (My start date February 7, 2021)if your forced extra day (MET) happens to be Saturday, then this October 2021, they chose to only target YOU and not the other 2/3 of employees on your general 40 hour a week schedule, who received no mandatory extra days (they had some voluntary extra time offered if they wanted and everyone had a few extra day weeks in late September). Sound fair? To make matters worse they still apply the same metrics to you and weight your performance equally to your well rested coworkers Sunday-Wednesday. If your an over performer, then your injury risk is greatly increased by the constant extra stress you must put your body through to compete with your majority of coworkers assigned a normal schedule. In the end, this policy of targeting one shift code for basically an entire month of Mandatory extra days on top of 2 weeks in September that everyone was fairly assigned MET, totally changed my view of Amazon as an employee and customer which I am no longer. My general experience was actually kind of good and I had a great manager and PA, awesome coworkers, and the daily tasks are labor intensive but that was expected so it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an issue. Sad to say it was"

Amazon,1fjutjm8vu53l802,1,Go Somewhere Else!,Process Assistant (Supervisor),"Every horrible thing you\'ve read about working for Amazon is true! They take advantage of the hard workers and take them for granted, expecting them to carry the workload of the lazier people while getting paid the exact same amount, or less! When those hard workers get fed up and quit, the only ones left to promote are the people who don\'t deserve it, or the ones who have deserved it for years and kept getting screwed by the ""Amazon"" process. They preach fairness, but nothing is ever fair at Amazon! Senior ops continue to set you up for failure, then criticize your performance. Amazon only cares about numbers, and makes it very clear you are replaceable. Do yourself a favor, and go somewhere else where you\'ll be appreciated."
Amazon,1fjusefsst5l4800,5,Work from home!,Customer Service Associate,"I worked from home as a customer service associate using Amazon provided computer equipment. This included everything you would need to accomplish the job. The training was set for 4 weeks, full-time hours. However, 2 weeks was the actual training and the last two weeks, we were on the phones taking live calls. The trainers were really good and were always available for help. You were never really on your own and could go offline to get with the trainer. It was easy to get comfortable taking calls. The pay was $15/hr. I was hired as part-time flex which allowed lots of options to choose when you wanted to work. Hours averaged 20-25 per week. But, you may be required to work many more depending on the time of year and for Prime Day. Your paid time off was based on how many hours you worked. You are given a bank of unpaid time off hours to use when needed.  Management was very responsive to any personal concerns or requests. Great company to work for - at least in my experience. "
Amazon,1fjup273st54q802,1,Worst job ever,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"Wasted time thinking this job was fit for ppl who have a life outside of work and nope.

Amazon,1fjuii75ot4b9801,1,Prepare to be just a number,Warehouse Associate,"Amazon only cares about you as a number and not a person. This goes for every leadership, from Bezos to the Process Assistants. You might get a good one every once in a blue moon, but they'll be gone within a year. Once you don't perform to their standards, they will do everything to make your work like unbearable.Favoritism is rampant. If you're friends with the leadership, you can stand around and talk all you want, but if you're not, they'll make you do all the work. They'll send you all over the place to work on blue lit lanes and ignore the group of people standing around talking. This also goes for HR. I've been trying to get my school accomodation approved since August and just this week (November 7th) is someone actually helping me (the one good HR person I've dealt with in the whole building). I had to go on an unpaid leave to not get kicked out of the classes for being a no show because my work schedule wasn't excused. They'll approve schedules for under 30 hours for some lucky people but make the others go through hoops when they can only do 28. They'll lie to you to get you out of their office and they'll ignore the 20+ emails you said asking for some kind of help. The only good thing about this place are the benefits, but even then, the stress isn't worth it anymore. Don't work here if you don't have to. You can get benefits just as good somewhere else and be treated like a human being. "
Amazon,1fjuh32m4u1t1802,3,Productivity ,Warehouse Associate,The way the work day moves there is pretty slow. Although you may feel a little isolated and in your own bubble. Workers and staffs are nice and help you if you really need help. 
Amazon,1fjucd09go2h3800,4,Fast growing,Warehouse Associate,It was easy to see orders growing daily and overtime was always available.  They were clearly trying to build a bench by recruiting educated and talented people to pack books.  It was a little like survivor as a few lower rated employees were dismissed each Friday.
Amazon,1fju9dirgu2h2800,4,Great support from management,Recruiting Coordinator,"I was warned before coming into this role that I may not have a good work life balance. I have not found this to be the case at all; I work at most 40 hours. Compensation could be better, but there are good opportunities for job advancement."
Amazon,1fju0ton3u1am802,3,good for training for a super fast paced work environment,Customer Service Representative,working for them as a work from home seasonal employee taught me how to multiask in several different things at once and not have any advancement expectations.
Amazon,1fjtl93cvu2h2800,3,Okay,Prime Associate,It okay job fast pace but have to literally fight for hours that\xe2\x80\x99s sent to you at a certain time and day only thing I dislike. Not the best place too work while pregnant still have too lift heavy stuff.
Amazon,1fjtjof58s7n1801,5,"Awesome benefits and granted hours, the best place to work",Associate,"Employer give great benefits and yours hours are granted, so if one day there is less job, you can do your hours anyway.  You have the opportunity to move up in the company in different management or technology positions.  "
Amazon,1fjt4pk5ut4b9800,5,great company to work at,Sortation Associate,"jus tdo you job and you will have no problem getting through amazon. its a little work intensive but with the added  benefits and perks, it makes working here worth while."
Amazon,1fjse3mupu1t1800,4,Schedule and easy work ,Fulfillment Associate,The set schedule is nice. Also being able to work extra overtime if needed. Learning new tasks is hard only when they need people to learn them. Training could be better more involved and challenging for the trainee. 
Amazon,1fjs95bjho2h4802,4,Good place to work if you don't mind accomplishing a certain amount of work every hour. ,Order Picker,"They are strict with the production and re train you if you get slow. But it's not that bad. Picking sucks!!Lunch breaks suck, once you log out they start timing your break and you have to be logging back in by the end of your break, it's so full, sometimes you have to walk to the front of the building to their main lunch room to eat or you would have to eat outside. Managers change all the time, my second manager actually recognized me for my hard work several times. Some managers never know what to do, also HR takes care of literally everything, I always asked myself why we had managers if we always had to talk to HR?"
Amazon,1fjs5o4sct4b9801,4,Always driving to be customer obsessed ,Area Manager,Great and stable company but shifts are too long and demanding. The first two years of compensation are great and the Stock options/rewards do help for the future. Better pay and more stock options should be awarded based on Company profits and financial results/sharing.
Amazon,1fjruhk80o2h4801,5,Great overall,Picker/Packer,"Apply and work there. It is challenging work, however you are getting paid to exercise. Stay focused and attentive. You can loose your job easily if you are a follower. Great company to work for. "
Amazon,1fjrj752oo2h3801,5,Great place with high expectations ,Fulfillment Associate,"Really smart people, a lot of opportunity for growth, always encouraged to be innovative, think big, and create something new. Competitive salary and benefits with other major tech companies. 100% self motivating work environment. No dress code and 4 legged friends are welcome. "
Amazon,1fjre9u6lt4b9800,4,Nice pay ,Warehouse associate,"Managers talk to you like you\xe2\x80\x99re a child , some of them treat you with respect . Workers don\xe2\x80\x99t really care about workload just there to get paid . Good benefits "
Amazon,1fjr5q6fuu1am802,5,Great place ,Warehouse Associate,Great Job. Nothing to complain about. Work and life balance. PTO whenever you need. Managers are understanding. Coworker were nice as well. Hours were good
Amazon,1fjr49f9lt4bb802,2,Disorganized Chaos,Warehouse Associate,"Was very disorganized. Moved me around 4-5 times between breaks, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even get a pace for the job because I was moved around too much. Everyone I talked to hated their life there and we\xe2\x80\x99re only there for the benefits and somewhat decent pay which still isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough for the amount of effort you put into the job to hit your numbers. "
Amazon,1fjqc9jcku1am802,4,Job is a job,Stower/Picker,Really simple job doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require to much just keep a decent production time && stay to yourself. Time does go by slow because your working alone but no drama. You barley see management and that\xe2\x80\x99s a plus in my book. Come to work do my job and go home.I feel like they would pay more but the pay is decent. You can move up easily and always advance. 
Amazon,1fjqbjhchu1am801,2,Mandatory overtime,Fulfillment Center Associate,"Amazon enforces mandatory overtime for warehouse workers. During peak season (the week of Prime Day and everything from Thanksgiving to New Year's), you can expect to work 60 hours a week. The amount of overtime is not clearly advertised in any of the job listings, which is extremely misleading."
Amazon,1fjq7l82qo2h4801,3,Boring long shifts,Warehouse Worker,"Amazon has pros and cons. Pros include flexibility, cons include super boring long shifts. The time goes by super slow. I got burnt out super quick. After a year I am looking for employment elsewhere. "
Amazon,1fjpv15tro2h4800,3,Not too bad,Warehouse Worker,Decent place to work. You can do whatever you want and as long as you are not a lazy person you should be fine working here. Lots of people complaining but what can you do about ut.
Amazon,1fjplds9gu1t1800,1,Move on in your Job search,Warehouse Worker,"I am by no means a Marxist, but working at Amazon made me completely understand the appeal. The rate system is atrocious and should be abolished. It\xe2\x80\x99s not physically painful but it has the mental effect of feeling like you are being whipped to do your work. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen robotic, soulless people who only care about their career get completely crushed by this environment. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to succeed. They want you to fail so they can bring in someone fresh and less cynical. That is, people who are notYET cynical."
Amazon,1fjn379n7u1am801,5,Great work life balance (WFH),Virtual Customer Service Associate,"I was a customer service rep, work from home. Scheduling was flexible and management was friendly and supportive. I liked that I was able to learn different departments. I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t like that they don\xe2\x80\x99t give you much of a heads up before switching you to another department. You have to learn to adapt in order to survive. Numbers are really important. As long as you do what you\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to do you\xe2\x80\x99re good. Training was good they give you all the info you need, just don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid to ask questions."
Amazon,1fjn247ldu1am802,1,Not a good place to work,Inbound Associate,For the amount of labor and the amount of money Amazon makes the pay is decent but not great. You can advance but it's few and far between. The management is probably the worst part of this job.
Amazon,1fjmujdhft4bb802,1,Awful,Pit Operator,Do not work here. You are very replaceable. They dont even interview you. Breaks are way too short for a 10  hour full time shift. Management does not care and the training is a joke.
Amazon,1fjmt93rcu1am802,3,"Sweaty, Fast Paced, Repetitive",Amazon Warehouse Associate,"The managers were all very cool, but most of the stuff that I disliked about the job were out of their control. The work was very sweaty, repetitive, and seemed never ending. 1:20am to 11:50 am makes it almost impossible to have a healthy sleeping schedule. The attendance policies are pretty lenient , but if you go negative on UPT you are fired on the spot. "
Amazon,1fjmjn5nmu1am800,2,Why Amazon doesn’t care.,FC Associate I,Amazon is a company that has a fast processing weight high turnover for employment that\xe2\x80\x99s managers and crew only thing they care about is the bottom line in products out no matter what and ask for leader ship moving up few and far between and yes this is coming from a current employee this is like a fast food restaurant if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get out stuff quick enough you get five best bet is this a temporary company find a better place to work and you will be OK.
Amazon,1fjmiuqd5o2h3802,3,Order Picker,Amazon Non Inventory Reciever,They will drive you to push harder and harder no matter how successful you are. They will promote people over the hardest workers who  are from a different job entirely. Management is lackluster and interviewing for promotion is based off of scripted answers. Ridiculously stupid. Don't work here if you are a hard worker.
Amazon,1fjmggqhio2h2802,3,Easy work long days,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"Not too bad of a place to work. You can leave the same day if you have time saved up. But if you go negative in your time, you will have to go talk to HR, and depending on how the conversation goes, they can fire you on the same day without notice, if you go negative."
Amazon,1fjmg3vh4t4bb801,2,Its a goob job with no experience or traingf,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,If you are a hard worker you have to work harder and the lazy people get away with a lot. Their are some good managers that show you appreciation. Their is a lot of favoritism in the job.
Amazon,1fjmfggdao2h2802,3,Not a bad place to work,Picker/Packer,If you need a job they will give one not back breaking work just constantly on your feet it can get  a Lil tedious don't forget good shoes cause you will be standing 
Amazon,1fjmf0dieo2h2802,1,Horrible management ,RC RECEIVING,They really just give anyone a chance at moving up but they do get fires easily by lack of experience. I encourage anyone to give anywhere else a chance because you will be burnt out by the zoo management they have going on. At least at the warehouse I was located at. 
Amazon,1fjmd9ra7u1t1800,1,"Nepotism, warehouse overly dirty,  401k",Warehouse Associate,"Amazon is all about bringing in the money.  If you have an Amazon 401k, READ THE PLAN FOR RESTRICTIONS AND VESTING, page 17.  Isles 101 through 191, see dust and mold clinging to beams. makes workers sick.  Good place to get covid19.  In the Stow dept, the PA has a son and niece working as well in this department. The three of them are mean to workers they do not like. They work as a team...it is weird.  "
Amazon,1fjmbhvi7o2h2802,1,soul wrenching,Warehouse Package Sorter,"takes your soul from you, long hours, above average pay, boring job, always on your feet, the job is not mentally stimulating, workers are basically collateral to the corp."
Amazon,1fjm4tg0su2h2802,3,isolating,Outbound Packer,"it's a decent place to work if you enjoy being alone but if you value your mental health, probably reconsider. the hours are fixed so you can be reassured with that. the other employees are kind... if you find time to speak to them. "
Amazon,1fjm4kuiis7n1800,2,It’s Amazon,Fulfillment Associate,"Long overnight hours, unrealistic production quotas, little time off options, long walks to and from breaks, no teamwork, back breaking, no real room for advancement "
Amazon,1fjm3fo5nu2h2801,4,Productive okay ,Personal Shopper,It was pretty ease most of the time all the hardships came through the big orders which required multiple carts and a lot of time bagging items and making sure everything you got was corrrect
Amazon,1fjm1j0odu2h2802,2,Schedule organization needed,Fulfillment Associate,"Overall it\xe2\x80\x99s an okay place to work.  they should allow us to shift around to learn different positions, because being stationed in one spot isn\xe2\x80\x99t something I care for. That would also keep them from sending you home when they run out of stations for you to work at."
Amazon,1fjlvqctmu2h2801,4,Good opportunity and good company ,Fulfillment Center Associate,Pretty easy job just very repetitive. The manages and supervisors don\xe2\x80\x99t really work with a specified group it\xe2\x80\x99s always changing so it seems as if the managers don\xe2\x80\x99t really care about the staff and they are just their doing the bare minimum just like the rest of the entry level jobs.
Amazon,1fjlqeqhbt4bb802,5,They seem to give people with all types of backgrounds a fair chance and the tools to succeed.,Amazon Air Gateway Associate,"Great company to work for in my opinion. Very diverse environment, which I personally love. There are some pretty genius people working for Amazon who may have never realized their own capabilities had Amazon not given them the opportunity. "
Amazon,1fjlp050ht4bb802,4,Ambiente de trabajo normal pero pago muy bajo ,FC Associate I,"Bajo salario para las m\xc3\xbaltiples funciones ha realizar, no hay overtime disponible."
Amazon,1fjloruh7t4bb801,3,Mundane and Repetitive,Warehouse Associate,"Worked part time for over a year and did mostly the same thing everyday, standing at a computer and processing customer returns, which got boring fast. Only got trained in a different section after 6 months of employment which I enjoyed way more but was never consistently able to work that section of the warehouse. Rarely meet my managers but the ones who did reach out to me were very nice and caring. Overall good pay and benefits but just way too repetitive of a job for me and the workplace culture felt non existent."
Amazon,1fjli1fnvu1am801,1,work isn't bad but management is terrible ,Amazon Warehouse Associate,Work isn't bad but management is terrible almost as if corporate forces them to be petty and vindictive. Also there's a lot of favoritism. People will walk in the door and get promoted if they become friendly with management  while people there for years get overlooked 
Amazon,1fjlhq21ju2h2802,3,Back breaking work for 12 hours,FULFILLMENT ASSOCIATE,Great benefitsGreat PayLong HoursCant use vacation time during peak season30 min lunch for a 10-12 hour day2 15 min breaks that's really 10 minutes because walking time is included in your break because break rooms are so far away.You can use PTO anytime and Unpaid time is good to have for emergencies
Amazon,1fjl1crvft4b9802,3,Okay ,Package Handler,Long hours and management teams kind of don\xe2\x80\x99t exist nothing new or any type of job advancement you do the same thing everyday unless another dept is short and they notice you\xe2\x80\x99re not feeling it anymore. But the pay is good for part time 
Amazon,1fjkihjtiu1t1800,5,Productive and fun place,Worker,Would recommend 10:10Enjoyed my time thereEasy workloadManagement were awesomeNice facilityCoworkers were diverse and knew how to work in a group dynamic 
Amazon,1fjkhtj21u1t1802,1,Overworked for the pay. No life outside work,Warehouse Associate,They have you working 10-12hrs a day 4 days when holidays come around it mandatory over time up to 6 days for 3 weeks or longer. You have no life outside amazon. After you work week is done all you want to do is sleep.
Amazon,1fjkhenoko2h3800,5,Picker,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Good job while in college. Can be repetitive but the people make it worth while. It is a very labor intensive job meaning you will be walking a lob and carrying boxes.
Amazon,1fjkfv9e7u2h2800,4,Chill place to work,Warehouse Associate,Little hours when i worked there but overall the people were somewhat cool to talk to the managers weren\xe2\x80\x99t that great thats why they switched out from time to time 
Amazon,1fjkcur04u2h2801,3,Overworked and underpaid,Picker,The do not care about you at all. I just got fired yesterday because I have had alot of emergencies come up in my family. They work you like a dog. Don't work here it's a complete waste of time. The managers are rude and only care about the paychecks. They don't come to you and ask if there's anything you need you have to walk to them. Their stairs are ridiculous and they purposely put me on the fifth floor all the time and I was set for Second floor 
Amazon,1fjkcum6vo2h2802,3,Not the best but its a great job if you get the right location,Fulfillment Associate,The first time I worked at Amazon it was great! But the split shift was terrible. You work 3 to 4 hours and get an hour and a half break in between. It depends what you like. I can say right now in my area they have tons of jobs and they pay good.
Amazon,1fjkcd16co2h4800,3,Longest days of my life. ,Packer,"I am a packer at a warehouse. I pack boxes for 10 hours a day. That's it. Nobody talks to anybody. The managers don't know my name. It is a long hard day. But, they pay well and have great benefits. "
Amazon,1fjka9foeu1t1800,2,Cut throat mission for yhe young at heart,Procurement Manager,They only care about you when you are willing to change hours constantly. Give your all and more and they will use you up fast. Need to be Unionised to be safe. Not a very safe company.
Amazon,1fjk9gvjht4bb801,2,Unreasonably high expectations of productivity,Prime Now Associate,"Warehouse work is unreasonably fast paced and tiring. There are extremely high expectations of productivity that aren't reflected in the medicore pay,"
Amazon,1fjk8c46uo2h3801,3,The work at Amazon is boring,Assistant Manager,"I worked for Amazon for a little over a year and in that time, I went from being a Tier 1 to getting 2 promotions and becoming an Assistant Manager, I believe there is a lot of room for growth but same as everywhere, you need to want to grow and you need to work for it. It can be pretty physically demanding so please keep that in mind when applying"
Amazon,1fjk7b50co2h4800,2,"Long hours, lots of cardio ",Amazon Delivery Driver,"If you like cardio then this job is for you, it starts small then you\xe2\x80\x99re expected to deliver roughly 300 packages a day after about a week of training, I have to sprint every package, all day to get done in time. Others have said it\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x9clearning curve\xe2\x80\x9d but it\xe2\x80\x99s honestly just exhausting. I will say it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to work alone listening to music most shifts, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not much brainwork at all, it\xe2\x80\x99s just physically demanding. "
Amazon,1fjk38acfu1am800,1,Coworkers are nice,Sortation Associate,Warehouse job is laborious and draining. I would not recommend working there unless you come in as an upper level such as a tier 4 position. Oh and your manager changes continuously without notice. 
Amazon,1fjk2m8uts7n1800,3,n/A,,It was cool it\xe2\x80\x99s a job honestly you going to work especially during the holiday season. The hours are long and the pay is okay it\xe2\x80\x99s better than most jobs
Amazon,1fjk0bj7jt4bb801,1,Horrible,Warehouse Worker,I do not recommend this company. If you work in the warehouse or you're a delivery driver you will be overworked and mistreated. The pay is horrible also. 
Amazon,1fjjuc4gmo2h4800,4,Very productive,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"Great place to work, very good pay and also good breaks and also A great managed team to work with, also you are paid for time off that\xe2\x80\x99s a great plus for working for Amazon "
Amazon,1fjjt8gmqu1am802,3,It was a job,Logistics,"The pay is good for what you do. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very simple job, you work hard and you are on your feet for 10 hours a day. It\xe2\x80\x99s very fast paced and they track your work through out the day. "
Amazon,1fjjskvjmo2h4800,4,It's Warehousing,Associate,It's one of the better warehouses to work for. The work is not that hard but gets boring quickly. There are opportunities to move around but realize this is a massive company so its easy for managers to forget about you.
Amazon,1fjjsdbvut4bb800,5,Great people throughout the organization - only issue was talent management,Program Manager,"Loved my time at Amazon and learned a lot there. I worked within Amazon CS and seller support. Lots of very talented and caring individuals at Amazon. Only thing I despised was Amazon's talent management practices which involved stack ranking of employees which factored into annual compensation changes, this led to great employees essentially being punished for being on a high performing team. "
Amazon,1fjjp5qveu1t1800,4,Productive and inclusive workplace,Warehouse Associate,Pretty good place to work. Everyone is very helpful and welcoming to new hires. Got a .75 cent raise after about a month working there. Had a great manager that made workers feel appreciated. Would definitely recommend working there. Only thing that was stressful was the mandatory overtime during peak season.
Amazon,1fjjo1ge4t4bb800,3,Good pay if you don't mind night shift.,Warehouse Associate,"Not the best place to work but they basically hire anyone, compensation is good but it's what you expect from working at Amazon. They are really demanding on safety, diverse employees. "
Amazon,1fjjmt729s7n1800,3,Warehouse Job,Fulfillment Associate,"It's a warehouse job. As a picker, I stand there for 10 hours picking items off the robots that come by. Not hard work, but mind numbing. Get two 30 min breaks, one paid and one unpaid. Pay is ok, there is a differential for part time weekend work and overnight. Easy to pick up shifts, easy to request time off using pto or upt. Easy to leave early if you have pto. All done on the app."
Amazon,1fjjm9trso2h4800,4,Cool place to work if you need quick cash,Delivery Station Liaison,I love the hours. I normally work 3 days or 24 hours per week and I get excellent benefits. Lunches are 1 hour and 20-minute breaks. Managers are virtual and we rarely ever see them.
Amazon,1fjjm8s7ao2h4802,2,Meh,Customer Service Representative,"It's ok Busy, back to back calls all day every dayNot organized, bad trainingNo room for advancementDecent work life balance, a lot of weekends off"
Amazon,1fjjlgc22o2h3800,4,"Tough work, especially during busy season",Sortation Associate,There will always be something to do at Amazon. I worked at sortation in the delivery station. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good entry level with benefits and stock options. No one will tell you off the bat the benefits and how to access information. Learn as you go and ask the people that\xe2\x80\x99s been around. 
Amazon,1fjjl72p5u1t1802,1,Horrible Warehouse Culture,Dock Clerk,"Honestly, there's not a lot of good I can say about working in this warehouse environment. The management was overall pushy and god awful. You feel pressured and stressed to meet a minimum rate, and the work is typically hard on your body. They really don't compensate enough to work their, despite being a billion dollar online retailer. Pretty sad and pathetic. I was denied advancement to the position I was already doing (but not being paid for), due to not interviewing the way that Amazon does it (the STAR method??). Overall a frustrating experience and the shortest I've ever worked for a company. Complete and total drain on my life."
Amazon,1fjjfk3bvt4bb802,1,Depends what you're looking for,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"I worked at Amazon in 2020, decided to apply after seeing the $1200 sign on bonus.  The hours are flexible and the job can be rewarding and time can go by quickly.  Yet management is non-existent, training was dismal at best, and they were late 3 weeks to get me the sign on bonus.  Initially I noticed many production level errors that led to extra work for the replaceable minions running the floor.  Dock supervisors not having the foresight to pull trailers and leaving packages to jam on football field lengthed conveyor belts.  Along with production errors there were numerous safety issues that were not addressed, thankfully I had experience and could avoid these situations, but often had to point them out to new hires and people who worked there for a long time and just seemed not to care.  After my second week of not receiving my bonus, I began to ask other employees of they had received theirs.  It was mixed and some said they had worked there for months and never received their bonus.  It seemed Amazon's hope was for employees to quit before they were due the bonus.  I continually went in to speak with management and finally I did receive the bonus.  Overall it can be a good first job or for someone looking to make extra money.  Hold management accountable and make sure to collect your bonus.  They play the numbers game and hope to win.  Good luck.  "
Amazon,1fjjefk75u2h2801,4,Productive workplace,Sorter/Packer,"Lots of great benefits, workers and management is very helpful, but very hard work on the body which is understandable. You can switch between different positions or hours if needed."
Amazon,1fjjcso5vu1am800,5,great work enviorment,Shift Assistant,amazon is a great place to work very fast paced and theres alot of room for advancing in a decent amount of time and when holidays come its like another family they have so many parties and gifts for staff its an awesome place to work.

Amazon,1fjive273s7n1801,3,Was fine until it wasn't. ,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"this was my first job starting in 2018 and I always worked mornings. Consistently from around 5AM to 9AM. Was all well and good until they updated to an ""omega cycle"" which made it from 2:40AM to 1:15PM. Moved to an evening shift which was miraculously shut down to work the new shift. I had reduced time from 2:40AM to about 9:10AM. Wasn\'t at all healthy regardless and I never got appreciation for my work even when I was doing great. That said everyone is nice and for the most part treat you well, and they do feed you and always offer water on hand. Good people just work that I don\'t think it worth it. "
Amazon,1fjimbnoou1am802,4,No real complaints,Warehouse Associate,"Only been there a few weeks but seems like an OK place to work. No complaints regarding management. I'm sore after every shift but I'm 60+ too. Not really the place if you want a leisurely work day, they keep you moving."

Amazon,1fjieaa8io2h2802,1,Not a fun place to work,Warehouse Associate,I heard a lot about how Amazon employees are badly treated but I decided to give a try to this company. The truth is except the quite decent pay I did not appreciate anything when I was working for this company. My earnest prayer is to never and I say it again NEVER go back there again. 
Amazon,1fjid806mu2h2800,1,No respect,Crew Member,Great benefits with limited education opportunities paid by company up front once approved. Mangers there only to push production forward. No company culture.

Amazon,1fjhst43qt4b9800,3,It was difficult ,Amazon Fresh Associate,"Managers were always acting as if they were above people , I left because we were treating unfair ! I had to leave for my mental health but the coworkers had problems also, you have to have thick skin working there , It was always people favoring others it was annoying , overall the pay was good , but working there I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bare any longer they fire you over the silliest things. managers only care when you not on ya job  "
Amazon,1fjhr15q9u1am801,3,It’s Ok,Non-Inventory Receiver,Working at an Amazon FC has its up and downs. You are a pawn in the grand scheme of things. the Scope of your job will be clearly laid out for you so you know what to expect. Some people can handle it if they have no better choice or option. 
Amazon,1fjhq573et4bb800,5,Productive,FC Associate Direct I,I am excited to work with Amazon as an Associate I. I would like to continue to work for that company because it takes care of their employees by giving them good benefits.
Amazon,1fjhmgo3vu1am802,1,just a number,Fulfillment Associate,"your just a number.I would rather work at a fast food place than work here.need some real management there .plus, its so unorganized noone know what to do or someone is always trying to blame someone else for their mistakes"
Amazon,1fjhgg6i2o2h2800,2,Back breaking work,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"The pay isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth being exploited like this. I am very young and able, some may even call me athletic, but it\xe2\x80\x99s till a lot of physical work. When you get off of work everything shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel exhausting. I don\xe2\x80\x99t work with or around people but some how I\xe2\x80\x99m mentally, socially and emotionally drained at the end of my shift."
Amazon,1fjhgaa9du1t1801,5,I love it here ,Loss Prevention Specialist,"Being a L4 LOS my workday consist of analytical research, travel, and handling a variety of calls from theft calls to workplace violence. They paid for all my certifications WZ included which is a 600 dollar course. I support about 32 sites between myself my manager and my RLPM. last work trip we supported a few sites had dinner went to a hockey game and then volunteered at a soup kitchen in Brooklyn NY. I love it "
Amazon,1fjha8stju1t1801,1,Horrible place to work ,Amazon ,Horrible place to work. You will not like this job just being honest. To be one of the largest companies in the world. It\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassing on how this job is 
Amazon,1fjh859iou1t1801,2,Ok pay mind numbing work,Dock Worker/Forklift Operator,Pay was decent for what I was doing.  Great benefits.  That's where the good stuff ends.  Actual work was just so boring.  If you want something easy and not at all challenging this is for you.
Amazon,1fjh7o8dmu1am802,3,Overall an okay job,Fulfillment Associate,Work is difficult but doable. You get used to the work load but the associates can be helpful through the process. Training is helpful but yet the job is doable 
Amazon,1fjh68sugu1t1800,5,fun place to work at.,CEO/Owner,"It\xe2\x80\x99s a fun place when the right people are working, when they have a good attitude. Normally it\xe2\x80\x99s a good environment. Only bad thing is you have to be working consistent full time hours in order to receive any benefits."
Amazon,1fjh3qv47t4b9801,5,"Stairs lots of stairs, long walk to bathroom ",Inbound Sales,"You must be able to work fast keep up with the rest of the people, you until you move faster then they'll show you how to move faster then you have to walk long line to the bathroom or the breakroom up the stairs down the stairs and then if you want to leave to go outside down 3  flights of stairs 18 each turn then out the door walk to your car walk back walk up 3 flights of stairs 18 on each turn and then walk down the hallway to  get your orders and go to your station.  Great Place to work."
Amazon,1fjh2nepsu2h2800,5,Great job,Shopper,Great job it better to they pay great u can work more hours with no problem I love the work they have for people it better but it a great job work is better 
Amazon,1fjh2ccgvu2h2802,5,Excellent co-workers and management was always right there to help if you needed.,Packer,Loved being able to cross train to other departments. Benefits were very good. If you had any questions or needed assistance with something you were able to get the help you quickly.
Amazon,1fjh0pf74u2h2800,4,Monotonous and stale,Warehouse Worker,I really have no complaints about anything besides the work being very very repetitive. I was an order picker and repeated the same 45 second process for 10 hours a day. sure driving the order picker is cool and exciting at first but over time it will lose its luster. The job itself is not difficult. the hardest part is having the mental stamina to not go insane while completing the same mindless tasks. Anybody with arms and legs can do this job... also was promised $18.60 an hour and only ever saw 18...
Amazon,1fjgsj7qmt4bb800,1,Worst Managed Place,Fulfillment Center Associate,This is by far the worst managed place I have ever worked at. Nobody wants to train you from the start. I learned the most from my coworkers. Every single day they come up to me complaining about something new that I\xe2\x80\x99m not doing good enough. You could be the best worker there and they\xe2\x80\x99d still pick on you. Not once have I been given actual constructive criticism or felt like I was even kind of appreciated. Being in this place makes you feel nothing but negative. Thought I could stick it out here but management has made it unbearable. I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken with coworkers that have been there for a while and they say that managers pick favorites and it really shows.
Amazon,1fjgrsctqo2h4802,3,"Fast paced, busy",Warehouse Associate,"When I worked there, I felt that the work wasn't too difficult if you were able to work with the physical requirements they had. It could be very fast paced, especially around the holidays. However, it would also be slow sometimes with barely any packages coming in."
Amazon,1fjgqfj1uu1t1800,5,"Good pay, but it gets repetitive ",Amazon Fulfillment Associate,I honestly don't think it's that bad. The benefits suck and not having sick time is ridiculous. The upt system is stupid and shifts are to long in ny opinion.  
Amazon,1fjgqfb7nt4b9800,3,A Love/Hate relationship,Warehouse Associate,"My job was all over the place. Numerous tasks were done to get packages ready for customers (the stuff I did near the end of my time was mostly fluid load work, which is not fun in summer weather), management changes every few months (most of them were fine, yet a few had a no compassion/all business mindset that I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand), many colleagues have come and gone during my time yet they have all been supportive just as much as I supported them, breaks (regular and lunch) were nice yet too short, the noise level is too loud for me, and career growth opportunities were difficult to spot all around. So overall, working for Amazon is not the best job in the world,  but not bad either."
Amazon,1fjgllctgo2h3800,4,Helpful coworkers ,Delivery station warehouse ,There are helpful coworkers and management also provides time to walk to lunch and break. There are also time clocks in the A to Z app and inside the warehouse which makes it easy to access. 
Amazon,1fjglj9keo2h2802,2,No job security,Cloud Support Engineer,Amazon has no job security. You can get fired at any time. I would recommend to avoid this company. It is purely an employer profiting company and do not care about employees. HR fires people without any appropriate reason. The worst place to be hired is the Seattle and portland area
Amazon,1fjg8gs9uo2h3801,4,Plenty of VTO ,Air Gateway Ramp Associate,Time off (voluntary) is amazing. What other employers offer the opportunity to leave work early without negative impact to the employees.  COVID time off if you catch it plus paid time off to recover. Unlike other companies who are shady and do not proactively offer COVID pay. People at this Amazon location are overall friendly and foster a positive environment for all.
Amazon,1fjg7u4nsu2h2800,4,For a EMT it’s ok ,EMT-B ( OMR),If you want to genuinely help patients I would not recommend being an OMR at amazon. The job is primarily paperwork and when you do get to treat you have to water it down to try to get associates to stay on-site . The reality is you can\xe2\x80\x99t really help people like you would on the road but I guess it is different being in a facility that runs as a business. The good thing is you learn a ton and sometimes there are fun calls to the floor like seizures or someone passing out. 
Amazon,1fjg78ar9t4bb800,5,dispatching was repetitive sitting and watching monitors,Dispatcher/Driver,"A day at work as a dispatcher, punch in, go to work area wait to get assigned to cities to dispatch. You get relief for break also you get relieved for lunch . work until time to punch out. The job was not hard. Learned how to assign drivers to locations for delivery."
Amazon,1fjg2r436o2h3800,4,Robot work,Warehouse Worker,"The work is repetitive but not hard, great place to earn extra cash very flexible schedules i definitely would recommend to students and people looking for a job in which they choose schedule."
Amazon,1fjfn6domu1t1800,1,This is temporary  transition job. They absolutely do not care about their employees.,Warehouse Associate,"This is temporary  transition job. They absolutely do not care about their employee's. They have a high turnover rate, and is very possible you will be injured on the job due to lack of safety and training. Work at your own risk."
Amazon,1fjfll6mco1mu802,1,Don’t work here,Logistics Specialist,They don\xe2\x80\x99t care if you have family. Management sucks big time. No one knows what their doing. We are not paid fairly for our work. I trained my manager but yet I get paid less? This company cannot keep working virtually
Amazon,1fjfho494t4l8800,1,It was terrible,Package Handler,"most of the coworkers were so lazy. And I had to work consistently. When I went home, my feet were so hurt and i was exhausted. I only worked for 4 hours per day, I couldn't do other job."
Amazon,1fjfbs9amt4l8801,5,Do your job and prove you can do the job if you want to move up ,Amazon Process Guide,I started with Amazon over a year ago and I\xe2\x80\x99m that time I was taught how to do many process paths and trained to be a PG and now inclined to be a PA. Show you can do the job if you are interested in moving up.
Amazon,1fjfas9jiu23q800,1,Horrible ,Warehouse Worker,"The job itself wasn't bad but the HR and ERC teams made me never want to come back. Mind blowing how horrible and lost they all were, they had no idea how to help and it seemed like no one knew what they were doing or were even trained at all honestly. Depending on what department you get the job itself could be easy but PRAY you never have any issues where you need to talk to anyone in HR or ERC because they will not be able to help AT ALL. "
Amazon,1fjfa1mjmt4l8800,3,Wasn't the greatest first warehouse experience ,Picker,Definitely not for someone who isn't ready to walk for their entire shift. Things changed after I left so I'm not sure about how it actually is now. Work at your own discretion 
Amazon,1fjf9r5mmu234800,3,Good pay but will overwork you,Warehouse Associate,"In the beginning it\xe2\x80\x99s decent. I started in June so it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of slow. Befriend the new hire trainers and get trained for as many tasks as possible so you won\xe2\x80\x99t get stuck on the lanes. You get free safety shoes when you start. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that I started in late 2019 left in the beginning of 2020 then came back in June 2021 at a different building. Everything was completely different. I worked at a sort center/part time building. Shifts are 4 hours but the amount of work you\xe2\x80\x99re expected to complete in that short time is very demanding. Also it\xe2\x80\x99s very common to \xe2\x80\x9cflex up\xe2\x80\x9d meaning you have to stay 15minutes to an hour longer based on the demand. If you leave, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be penalized. I worked mid shift & night shift. After about 2 months, I wanted to change my schedule. At my building they constantly push all the work onto night shift. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t need people for the shift you want, too bad for you. They are not flexible at all with shift changes or building changes. Why have it available if you don\xe2\x80\x99t approve it? I wanted to go to the building I was at when I first worked at amazon because there\xe2\x80\x99s more opportunities at that building but they never approved it. Also they don\xe2\x80\x99t approve vacation time unless you schedule it 2+ weeks in advance. With PTO, it\xe2\x80\x99s automatically approved. VTO is nonexistent (at least in my building) I ended up leaving because it just became unbearable- I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t change my schedule, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t vto available, I was using all my time off because my availability was changing. After 1 month and 3 declined schedule change requests , they finally approved"
Amazon,1fjf8i6s2t3ok800,4,Decent,Warehouse Worker,"It could be better, but it isnt bad. I assumed this place would give me a place to grow, but I was wrong. I dont know what else to say, but the pay is great."
Amazon,1fjf421i9u234801,4,Amazon is an amazing place to work and has many good benefits.,Customer Returns Processor,"Employees are treated with respect.  There is no racism.  Everyone is nice to each other and helpful.  The work is interesting and fun.  The hardest part of the job is the last two hours of a 10-hour shift because by then you're very tired. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with many interesting and diverse people.  You never have to worry about being asked to stay late.  You start and end your shift exactly as expected.  They also have a FLEX shift, which you can choose your hours and the time of day you wish to work.  I would recommend the FLEX shift experience if you're not needing a full-time job."
Amazon,1fjf0csmnu23q801,1,It’s terrible. ,Stower,"Never work at a Amazon. They will kill you\xe2\x80\x99re feet and non of these employees or managers will care for you. Plus, they\xe2\x80\x99ll pull you out from your comfortable position and make you do another task where it will ruin your day. "
Amazon,1fjeq4as7oc9d802,1,"Horrible, it's Amazon. There's a reason why no one makes it past 1 year of working there. ",Delivery Driver,"You\'re a number to them not a person. They make you feel guilty about a bathroom break because you\'re ""wasting time""... Frankly they\'re only worth it if you\'re getting a hiring bonus but after that just go find a better job "
Amazon,1fjepso90u2hh802,1,Bad,Package Handler,Do not work there the job sucks they treat you like dogs and have no respect for people they send home on covid leave and don't give you pay for them sending you home
Amazon,1fjep5lciu234800,3,I If you make adherience its any easy job for you.,CSR - Customer Service Representative,"I cannot speak for all managers, but all the ones that i came in contact with tried to work with you. Most of all they werent disrepctful. Now this is per my experience i cant speak for anyone else."
Amazon,1fjele1lbu2hh801,3,"Productive, but indifferent management. ",Warehouse Shipping and Receiving Associate,"Highschool mentality, if you stood out at all, you either worked more than you should, or were singled out constantly and unfairly. The only real good thing was being able to take time off pretty much whenever you wanted to, assuming you have the time saved up to use. "
Amazon,1fjel6d17s9sq800,2,Fun at times,Warehouse Worker,"Work was mundane and depressing due to the lack of sunlight and long hours. However, I worked Flex shift which allowed me to choose my hours. The pay was livable, especially when I worked overtime."
Amazon,1fjel5bs4u2hh801,3,It was ok,Dock Worker,"When I was on the dock it was okay, when I had to stop it was horrible. It was not the. Eat ace to work but it also was not the worst place to work..."
Amazon,1fjeis4l5t4l8802,2,Good temp job as picker,Picker,"A typical day at work is when you clock in and get your scanner. It then tells you where to go which can be 1st 2nd or 3rd floor. Warehouse is huge so you will surely get a workout in. Pay is decent but its mindless work and gets very boring after you get the hang of it. Not much support with managers, they are nonexistent most times."
Amazon,1fjeim6aqu23q802,3,Back breaking very physical workload,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"Prepare for aching feet and body. Breaks are very short. Bending stooping reaching and pulling/lifting heavy loads. You must be a hustler to get ahead, management loves people who suck up to them an act like their buddies. Audits on progress is daily."
Amazon,1fjeds5r7u23q801,3,Dps,Driver,Depend on what DPS you chose everyone is different. make sure they give right for driving stepvan also ask for bonus and always take your PTO dont let them abuse give you a lot of rescues. take your time on the road.
Amazon,1fjed1td6s9sq801,4,It's an exciting place to work at and also at times challenging,Ship dock,Working at this Amazon warehouse has been fun.  The department where I currently work at generally cares about your safety and not on you about your rate  in terms of scanning packages. They do not mind if you leave for lunch or break a couple minutes early. Benefits are good.
Amazon,1fje839a6oc9v802,4,A great place to work if you don’t mind physical labor,Inbound Stower,"I hear a lot of people say negative things about working at Amazon, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve been there for two weeks and I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel the same way they do. When people say these negative things I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s because they are lazy and do not want to do the work. I am an Inbound stower; so I scan items and put them in bins and then scan the bin which makes it available for purchase on amazon.com. I work four days a week 10 hours each shift and because it\xe2\x80\x99s peak season we do have mandatory overtime. However, when it is not peak season opportunities for overtime are usually  still available. So that is great if you were looking to pick up a couple of extra shifts,  some places of employment do not usually offer overtime so this is a nice benefit to have. The work can get repetitive scanning items all day long, but eventually you will find your groove and it can even become fun. Socializing and assisting other coworkers makes the job a bit more fun as well. My first week there I noticed there was a shoe center in the middle of the building. They had many shoes on display - Amazon offers their employees up to $120 credit towards a free pair of work shoes! I got a nice pair of Reebok for free! HR is on site and they are so extremely helpful! I go to turn for just about everything from timesheet and schedule questions, mental health resources, medical benefits enrollment, a lot ! My supervisors are all very kind and helpful when I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to do something they don\xe2\x80\x99t mind assisting. There are lots of room for advancement and after 2 to 3 weeks there you are offered to switch to a different position"
Amazon,1fje59112t3ok802,2,Good Benefits but no Work Life Balance.,AMZL Site Operations Manager,"The pay and benefits are a big draw for managers coming to Amazon but as a UTR delivery station manager you will work 12 hour day 5 days per week and at least 4-5 hours on the day you are off.  6 hours of each day is devoted to explaining to upper level manager root causes and plans for achieving bench marks and every day you miss you are on another call, the same call.  Knowing the leadership principles are essential to getting hired but they are not evident in the day to day operations.  I would not recommend a position in a delivery station on the UTR management team."
Amazon,1fje0re10u234800,3,No advancement,Store Associate,Amazon is a good company but failed to treat their employees fairly.  If you are an employee working as a shopper do not look for advancements. You will have to go to a different company to get that.
Amazon,1fjdr3bljt4l8801,3,Operations Manager ,Site Operations Manager,Job is a grind with duplicate efforts and really no carryover between decision makers. I made the mistake of leaving something I was very good at only to go to an organization that had everyone out for self
Amazon,1fjdpvcr9s9sq801,3,"Overall it’s good, just don’t know too much lol 😂 ",Problem Solver,"Overall good company, just wish they would do better about compensating for training/experience. A person should be paid accordingly if they know how to do 10 different jobs in that building AND solve every problem that each of those jobs encounters. Other than that, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good company with good benefits. There just needs to be more titles within the level 1 role due to many people having more experience than a basic level 1 associate who only does their home path. "
Amazon,1fjdfvu8rs9sq801,5,Excellent place to work,Manager,"Good pay and hours, growth and development. Build leadership and project abilities. Foundational principles to help you succeed anywhere. Very nice placet o worth"
Amazon,1fjdcojt0u2hh802,3,No work,Stower/Picker,"There's not enough work for everyone. At times they choose a handful of people to work, while everyone else has to pretend to stay busy most of the shifts"
Amazon,1fjd9mhj2t4l8802,2,Was okay..,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"I worked here back in 2019, I didn\'t feel like there was room to advance in the company, because it\'s all about ""favoritism"" instead of noticing people for their hardwork. By the way if you have heart problems or breathing problems, don\'t work for Amazon. They will work you like a dog. And the air filteration is trash. If you do your research, you\'ll see that many people have made complaints. "
Amazon,1fjd3dmrou234802,3,Buen trabajo aunque un poco pesado,Warehouse FC Associate,"Lo bueno es que te sientes en tu pais, casi todos hablan espa\xc3\xb1ol, pero es excesivo el trabajo para lo que te pagan, mucho estres, siempre te estan pidiendo numeros"
Amazon,1fjd1lo2ls9sq801,4,Easy to get hired and easy job ,Amazon Associate,If it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for management changes and supervision and some other things I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t comfortable with in my work environment I probably would\xe2\x80\x99ve stayed. The job is physically demanding but manageable since working at a sort center is mostly part-time and you get trained for some basic roles that do not require a lot from you. 
Amazon,1fjctuoqvoc9v801,1,Work here to get a check every week,Associate,"This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a place for a career. You need a check and you need to treat it like a side hustle to get your other side hustles going. Stay out of drama and don\xe2\x80\x99t look for management to help, find your group and move on. "
Amazon,1fjcslgl3t3ok801,1,Package handler ,Stower,Day at amazon long work hour days .learned how to work in very hard conditions and better communication. Work place culture is good work with very good people .hardest part of job working long hours management very honest 
Amazon,1fjbs7retu2hh801,5,Good job,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Good job but is part time 4 hours a shift. Much better for a single person who has a very flexible schedule. Usually when any extra shifts are available they are in the evening through overnight 
Amazon,1fjbpc4d6t3ok800,2,They do not take proper COVID 19 precautions ,Robotics Technician,The company treats you like a number and isn\xe2\x80\x99t worried about COVID safety The path to advancement is not by hard work but by involvement in social groups and other matrix points like wearing safety shoes The managers seem to care only about their numbers and not their employees but 
Amazon,1fjbmlb7su2hh800,1,"No one cares, you're a robot with blood.",Amazon Warehouse Associate,"No one cares, you're a robot with blood. If you like to walk in circles, scan a box, pick up a box, put down a box, and continue, then this the job for you.  "
Amazon,1fjbg9rbloc9d802,1,Disorganized ,Fulfillment Associate,They have no available schedules yet they have hiring events and continue to open up positions with no start date and schedule. Don't hold your breath.
Amazon,1fjavsfs8s9sq800,2, No good ,Order Picker,Poor management bad adatudes equipment not working properly the pay is poor the freezer is to cold they say you need to go into the freezer at least 2 hours a day I get seizures and they don\xe2\x80\x99t care about anyone except for them self the management don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know anything when someone ask the company don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough equipment for everyone they have young people who are not Able to answer anymore questions they embarrass people in front of others about their jobs examples ( speed performance after two days of start work no training when hired)
Amazon,1fjak6gdat3ok802,3,Not good long term ,Warehouse Worker,"Amazon is really only good as a stopgap employer or if you need some extra bucks as a part time worker. On the plus side, they have an app that makes working there flexible and the money is ok. But as a full timer, the hours really drag on and the company has made no real effort to make their jobs ergonomically safe, which is why I plan on leaving."
Amazon,1fjab2io9u234802,4,"Good pay, fast paced ",Production Worker,Demanding but rewarding if you care. You need to stay on top of production. Benefits are there and are good. Other than that typical warehouse environment.
Amazon,1fja9hh96s9sq800,4,Amazon was a stressful job,Retail Sales Associate,Working at Amazon don't go if you don't like stress because sometimes you may go home with headaches depending on the day. They time you on the packages you scan. 
Amazon,1fja987ovo1mu800,2,3 Strikes for False Occurrences,Fresh Associate,"Imagine going to work knowing that at the end of the day, you're getting disciplinary action on your days off for things that don't actually occur while you aren't there and aren't supposed to be there.  That is the experience I had.I quit because I could not trust them not to mishandle my personnel record and had grown bored with utilizing my own time at home trying to get the issues resolved.  Getting hired was bizarrely and uncomfortably easy.  I just filled out a short form on their website, and within minutes I was offered the job.  The work itself was pretty good, though.  I stayed busy and got good exercise.  Scheduling was extremely flexible.  I just...can't see any reason to believe they can ensure that my employee record is kept accurate and realistic.  Take a job here if you need some quick money but don't stay long."
Amazon,1fja3n9urs9sq801,2,its very physically demanding ,Warehouse Worker,the job itself is very easy you go in doing the same thing everyday. its great if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind moving a lot and carrying heavy boxes and not like to socialize.
Amazon,1fj9sansfo1mu802,4,Good job. ,FC Associate I,"Hours aren\xe2\x80\x99t bad, pay is good, break policy is a little tough. 10 hour days with 2 15 minute breaks. Could be a 5 minute walk to the breakroom and that time counts as part of your break. 30 minute lunch but it\xe2\x80\x99s 4 days a week."
Amazon,1fj9otj1lo1mu801,2,"Pay is great, Management is fine, but everything is robotic",Order Picker,"If you\xe2\x80\x99re someone who wants any type of social interaction in your life, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably not the job for you. Everything is timed, including your breaks. The other coworkers are really competitive; there is no teamwork. People act like one person doing good is going to threaten their job. Management is actually decent."
Amazon,1fj9ll524s9sq800,3,Complicated,WAH Logistics Rep,"Great pay and benefits. Management/leadership needs revamping. Some of them are very childish and rude. The scheduling is the real issue. They shift bid and this means you have no true stability or schedule. You can and will lose your ideal shift simply because you received bad reviews from a customer who did not get their way. You can have an amazing review 90% of your scheduled shift (6-8 weeks) and that last 10% you're receiving one star on all of your interactions and someone else is at 98% ...well, you just lost your shift AND the ability to bid for it. They'll block you to keep you from bidding on it."
Amazon,1fj9h5cucu234802,3,Feels repetitive and isolating,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,No meaningful skills gained on the job as most of the tasks are very simple. The hardest part is putting up with a noisy environment doing a repetitive task at a set pace which can become rather tiring after a while.
Amazon,1fj97inn6u23q800,4,Its a job,Sorter,"Don't expect a career. You go in,  do mindless work and then go home. I work part time at the sort center. It's not anywhere as bad as the media likes to make it sound. Yes,  they expect you to work when you are there.  It's not a place to socialize.Depending on your fitness level it can be tiring.My main complaint is that you don't get much extra compensation for time on the job. I get free dental and vision as a part timer"
Amazon,1fj95gtg2s9sq800,4,Productive fun place to work.,FC Associate,Amazon is a great place to work for.  My favorite things about working there is the flexible schedules and the ability to take any day off if you have the hours to cover it.
Amazon,1fj9111uko1mu801,5,Good job but corporate sucks,RTS Associate,"My view is skewed because I worked at the smallest Amazon on the west coast. However, the culture was amazing and it felt like a small family owned business, until corporate started stepping in more. The warehouse I worked at was only night shift which could be an issue for some"
Amazon,1fj90d4b1s9sq801,3,Blah,Account Change Support Representative,Just a person behind. You are judged by customer reviews which aren\xe2\x80\x99t always fair. When you work in account change if you\xe2\x80\x99re having a hard time you\xe2\x80\x99re pretty much stuck fendning for yourself
Amazon,1fj8pqh6nu234800,1,The it’s day 1 culture is damming. ,HR Associate-Disability/Leave Services,The company does not care about its employees and it\xe2\x80\x99s evident. They make you run through so many obstacles just to get time off to move. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like ABY WFH company that I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever worked for. 
Amazon,1fj8fl14bt4l8800,4,Great job for flexible people,Amazon Sortation Associate,Job fits well into my schedule.  Work is not overly demanding and environment is positive.  Volume of work does fluctuate which can create inconsistency but overall been a very positive experience for me.  
Amazon,1fj8ea8j3s9sq800,5,The good Always stands out ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Really enjoyed working for Amazon. Just didn't like how they said they fired me for job abandonment but I took a leave cause my grandfather died when his cancer came back

Amazon,1fj85ls5soc9v802,1,Work here if you need money,Worker (DSE4),"Do not personally recommend. I asked for a higher table or switch positions, due to how tall I am. And they said to either quit or talk with a doctor for accommodations, so I quit. I have also worked at DSP and that was super hard to keep up on all of the packages, and they never give you new positions. Pay was good, but I needed the money."
Amazon,1fj84v6aau234802,3,Decent,Floater for other departments,Pretty easy warehouse work just repetitive. The breaks could be long with it being a physical job and you are on your feet all day. The sort center is more enjoyable to work in than the fulfillment center by far.
Amazon,1fj7o0bncu234800,3,the benefits are excellent,Warehouse Worker,"excellent low cost health, vision and dental insurance with a lot of extras included. the A to Z app helps tremendously with any HR, scheduling or benefits questions. very easy to request time off or find extra shifts..and the safety shoes credit is awesome..with that being said ..the downside is the long 10 1/2 shifts standing 95 percent of the time..the heavy workloads of pkgs that are often 50lbs or more and having to repetively push, pull and lift said pkgs over the course of the shift, starting pay is decent but after being  successfully trained to operate any heavy equipment pay should be increased, shift differentials absolutely sucks ..60 cents more for nights is an insult! and the constant repetitive movements required to do most jobs here will definitely be causing work comp injuries..humans are not robots..and should not be expected to work according to the robot algorithms "
Amazon,1fj7lvq6vu234801,4,"Hard work, but simple",Warehouse Fulfilment Associate,"I found it to be a really fun and easy job. You are constantly doing the same movements, so it can being tiring for some people. They tack you every step of the way so you have to think smart about everything you do. If you're going really quick, take an opportunity to use the restaurant to slow down your time. If they see you are going really fast one day, they will expect it from you and get onto you if you are sick or not feeling well the next day. I only worked there a year and took the payout they offered after the peak season. It's a very physical job and my body couldn't take it any longer."
Amazon,1fj7khmppoc9d802,4,Get really cash out of working at amazon,Warehouse Laborer,"Pretty much i enjoyed working here, had good pay, was content, had tasks that'd keep me focused and occupied, it wasn't too bad.

Amazon,1fj7i9g6doc9v802,3,It’s fast pased,Amazon Warehouse Associate,Fast paced and don\xe2\x80\x99t really care if you\xe2\x80\x99re hurting. Recently had surgery and was released after 4 weeks of recovery. Tried to go back to work but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t handle the pain that was induced from lifting heavy objects.

Amazon,1fj7f6ials9sq802,4,"Still Working at amazon love it, BUT",Warehouse Team Member,"Good place to work, easy training, great benefit.

Amazon,1fj6n8b8tu234802,3,Good pay and flexibility ,Warehouse Associate,This is not a job for middle age or older or a professional seeking residual income. The work is very hard on the body especially if you are part time not worth your bodily health.
Amazon,1fj6n1eqku2hh801,2,"Overall, not a good experience",Warehouse Associate,"Amazon is really only good as a stopgap employer or if you need some extra bucks as a part time worker. On the plus side, they have an app that makes working there flexible and the money is ok. But as a full timer, the hours really drag on and the company has made no real effort to make their jobs ergonomically safe, which is why I plan on leaving. "
Amazon,1fj6erhe0t3ok801,3,Place where dreams go to die,Associate,It's just as bad as people say. Worked there for a few weeks and couldn't stand it. 10 hour shifts were atrocious. Management were unproductive and were not good at their jobs.

Amazon,1fj6aqgi3u234800,1,Poorly managed and hard to work with,Packer,"Not really suited for people with physical disabilities (unless you are college educated) and painfully hard to work with on workplace accommodations. They don't care much if you damage your body long-term on the job, just maybe give you some aspirin, and then a write-up for being too slow. Good for people who like to stick to the status quo, because most issues are ignored. And a massive amount of employee management processes are automated, which can lead to lost PTO and even job loss. I can't forget to mention the blatant anti-union propaganda in the bathrooms and the ban on chairs (WHY?) outside the breakroom in the building I work.If the other issues could be dealt with, the pay is good and it's a good place for both PTO and overtime. "
Amazon,1fj651u1bt3ok800,5,Adapting to a new work environment,Pharmacy Technician,"It is one those ""touchy feely let\'s be overly sensitive"" work places.I am from the old school so I have to adapt to this mentality but don\'t expect me to assimilate completely. There is no dress code which only further justifies my perception of  a less than professional workplace.. HR\'s blanket answer is go to the employee website. Which one? There was 3 of them last time I bothered to do so. People wise I sometimes feel like I am the only adult in the room populated by self centered entitlement seeking toddlers. I have often have heard the phrase "" I don\'t.wanna get yelled at."" I have never witnessed anybody being yelled at during my tenure. Yelled at? Really? Did management interrupt your sleepy time?The pay could be better but the benefits are first class. Individuals need to be held accountable for their behavioral problems."
Amazon,1fj61pd3st3ok801,4,Decent pay and benefits. Very clear policies,"Warehouse Associate, packer, picker, stower","If you can be on your feet for 10 hours per day, which may include a LOT of walking, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a particularly hard job. The pay is fair for the work. Good benefits. Accessibility of HR, management and ops is very open. Good communication of expectations with very clear policies regarding attendance, etc."
Amazon,1fj5o5jebu234801,5,DPP7 has the BEST culture ,Package Handler/Sorter,Great environment - I've worked at several PIT and FC locations.  This location has an amazing culture.  The employees seem really happy doing all the work required.

Amazon,1fj54aq48u2hh800,3,Ehh,Customer Service Representative,It\xe2\x80\x99s okay not the best; do your job and you won\xe2\x80\x99t get in trouble. Depends on your manager and you will succeed if they are good. If not then you will not have fun at work 
Amazon,1fj52vg8vu234800,5,Cool,Warehouse Worker,Cool place but just keep in mind that it is a warehouse so don\xe2\x80\x99t expect it to be easy. Fast paced but not heavy. Scanning and putting the box in the right tote.
Amazon,1fj4tmsi2oc9v801,4,Nice coworkers. Easy work,Warehouse Associate,"I was here for quite awhile which was around Q3-Q4. I did 4 tens then i had the rest of the week off. I swear they never pick the older people here to do the heavy lifting. It\'s very easy starting out but when you start gaining experience they\'ll start sending you out to inbound/outbound, x-wing, they\'ll have you throw boxes on the conveyor which is very physically demanding or run bags. The social distance people don\'t really do much here. They just stare at you while you work. Also the ""medical"" team here is kinda of a joke. If you break or sprain a bone they can\'t really do anything for you. Either use your vto to go home or they\'ll arrange an ambulance. Imo i think management just cares about metrics here with a laptop in front of their faces 24/7. I was also called ""skinny"", ""underweight"" or i would hear comments from management and coworkers that i should ""eat more"" which was upsetting. My co-workers in general were very nice. Pays great but its just alot of work"
Amazon,1fj4sj3m0u23q802,5,Productive fun workplace ,Customer Service Representative,Great pay flexible hours coworkers were great to get along with benefits are okay you have the opportunity to move up. Moving up in a company is something everyone looks for.

Amazon,1fj4f6qr3oc9v801,4,Fun place to work,Worker,It was a fun place to work but you will sacrifice your social life if you work graveyard shifts like I did. I like that they give you school accommodation.
Amazon,1fj4cukm0u2hh801,1,Start your HR career elsewhere,Senior Human Resources Assistant,"I was excited to get hired as a Senior Human Resource Assistant with Amazon.  This excitement changed to regret shortly after me starting.  The management and HR leadership are a joke.  They let the employees do whatever they want and if we push back we get in trouble, but they're allowed to talk to us and treat us any kind of way.  HIGHLY toxic and hostile work environment.  Pay and benefits were good. Even my fellow HRA's were awesome, but not the HR managers and Senior leadership....poor excuses for leaders.  "
Amazon,1fj4arb5ns9sq800,1,"Excellent pay and benefits, zero work life balance",Station Operations Manager,"Excellent pay and benefits but zero work life balance. 16 hour overnight shifts as an ops manager, not much support from senior leadership, hard work rarely recognized. Toxic work environment for the associates and management alike. Turnover is high."
Amazon,1fj48v2u9u23q801,2,Okay place to work,FC Associate I,"It was okay very tiring , didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a life and outside work, the managers were cool. They breaks are short and they over work you. They have high unrealistic expectations "
Amazon,1fj4857ptoc9v800,4,Flexible job with decent pay,Associate,Amazon is one of the few jobs that gave me options of flexible work in which I can choose which time and shift work best for me and with decent pay for a person just starting out.
Amazon,1fj46jemdoc9d802,3,"Good first job, not the best managing ","Picker/Packer, Stower",If your looking for a first job this is perfect but the job can take a toll on you depending on the department you get placed. Plenty of shift to pick from and benefits are great. Downfall is management plays favoritism but you can move up in the company if you wish. 
Amazon,1fj46fbl2t4l8801,1,You are looked at as a robot,Stock Picker,You are looked at as a robot. Everything you do is based off an algorithm that they see as what being efficient would be. It is completely unrealistic to meet.
Amazon,1fj42hepdt3ok802,4,It can be hard sometimes. ,Amazon Warehouse Associate,Just make sure to be punctual. Most managers should help you if not there is HR. Being careful  is important there can be a lot of things. Deaf people work here too. So be polite and positive.
Amazon,1fj3qn5d0u234800,4,"Alright for side hustle, not worth full time",Order Picker,"Great felxibility for side hustle, if you are a hard worker, its not worth it. Fun inclusive environment when I was was there, dont know if it is now. "
Amazon,1fj3pqk1ioc9v801,1,Better off working ANYWHERE else,Warehouse Associate,"Not a fun place to work at, always understaffed, favoritism, management sleeping with associates, unhealthy work environment, & always being overworked"
Amazon,1fj3pbov9u23q802,4,Good seasonal job,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Good money during Christmas time and flexible. Liked using an app to clock in/ clock out. A lot of hard work that will make your feet / back sore if you actually do the work. A lot of people do bare minimum or hide during shift
Amazon,1fj3lpem3oc9d801,1,Amazon cares about production only,Fulfillment Associate,"When hired,you are not a human,you are now assigned a badge and have joined the robot ranks for Amazon production. If you can't meet their quota, regardless of the reason, you get writeups until you are terminated. Don't get injured on the job either. They don't care how you got that way (even if it was someone else who injured you)."
Amazon,1fj3kp6uau234802,4,If you are productive you will succeed.,Forklift Operator,"Not for the weak, they will fire you if you mess around but there is still a lot of flexibility and the pay is good. I enjoy working at this amazon because it is a non sort and I drive a fork lift. "

Amazon,1fj3bf5ist4l8800,4,Leadership invest in professional development ,Warehouse Employee- Learning and Safety Specialist ,"If you are interested in improving yourself professionally, and/or getting another role with the company the leadership really fosters and helps with interview practice and providing education themselves or increasing access to education. Also maternity leave policy is great. They really take care of theur mommas working for them.  They reimburse for some college education as well. If you are determined and dig in to develop yourself, they invest in you. One caveat to this though is that I did already have a college degree when I started with them....however, I have seen leaders invest in others and when I became a leader myself, I did what I could to elevate my associates.I worked at a cross-dock warehouse. In 8 months I went from warwhouse floor worker to ""problem solver"", to seasonal safety specialist, and then to Learning Specialist. Intense busy times and rare expectations can really wear on people and lead them to make risky decisions because of how sick time policy was. People would come to work sick or have medical issues at work because of fear of losing pay or time..and exhausting their PTO balance that was a shared balance. Need possibly better egonomics training for new employees to prepare their bodies for the work"
Amazon,1fj3b5um4u23q800,4,Fast paced,Yard Specialist,I loved my time at Amazon. I would go back in a heartbeat if they would fairly compensate me for my work. I left because I was being as to drive tractor trailers while still being paid warehouse wages. Just them trying to get cheap drivers. I lived the peopled I worked with though.
Amazon,1fj3at5fuoc9v800,4,Fun place to work,Warehouse Worker,great pay with a lot of great people but managers also do a lot of favoritism so they usually let those people do what they want instead of working.

Amazon,1fj392hujs9sq800,3,Job is more difficult than needed ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Decent pay but hours are stressful and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter how hard you work. You are often forced to do task due to error from management and higher management 
Amazon,1fj2uqcdpoc9d801,3,Depends on the location ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"Some locations push rate and will have mangers that don\xe2\x80\x99t respect you, just your number. They try to strive for \xe2\x80\x9cquality\xe2\x80\x9d but praise you only for your speed/rate. My location isn\xe2\x80\x99t that bad, it\xe2\x80\x99s a simple job. Unfortunately our facility deals with more of the heavy items, more frequently than other warehouses. Be aware of the MANDATORY overtime as well, can\xe2\x80\x99t deny it & they can just slap it onto your schedule 24hr prior. "

Amazon,1fj2ff9i0oc9v802,3,Lots of work and can't slow down,Amazon Fresh Associate,"Job consisted of getting a shopping cart and going around the warehouse with a scanner, aisle per aisle looking for whatever people ordered. The warehouse is divided into 3 locations. Ambient where the room temperature food was located, chilled where the refrigerated food was and frozen where the frozen food is at. The job wasn't bad but you had to work quickly because you'll constantly be getting warnings that your productivity is going down if you don't pick food fast. "
Amazon,1fj2dgr95u2hh800,1,Amazon work environment,Stower,bad work environment for a job and no room for growth in the workplace would not recommend. Pay is good but the labor is a bit much with barely any time for breaks stow
Amazon,1fj2bfv2qochj800,5,Great work for a student,Prime Now Associate,Great place to work as a student. Extremely flexible hours made it stress-free to work at Amazon. They also took precautions to protect their employees when COVID-19 hit.
Amazon,1fj28t6ngnq2f802,4, I enjoy a 4 day work week with 3 days off,Stower/Picker,"I like Amazon, Even if it is can be tiring, I am a stower so my position includes putting items into pods. I like that Amazon has great benefits like dental. I pay less than 15 dollars for dental to cover myself and my domestic partner. Other companies do not let you cover domestic partner. Also I like how Amazon gives you time PTO (paid time off) about 1 hr 30 min weekly, and it accumulates fast. Also they give UPT (unpaid time quarterly) about 10 hours, and of course vacation. The best part is as long as you have the time you can clock out and use the time you have. You do not even have to get anyones approval before leaving AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THE TIME. I actually enjoy working 4  10 hour shifts. I think having 3 days off is the best way to recover and now I cannot go back to working 5 days a week for 8 hours. It just feels like an extra day off lost for no reason. I hope more companies can utilize the 4 day work week. Amazon also offers 3 day 12 hour shifts, but that's not for me lol. "
Amazon,1fj24n0bq3oce002,2,"Great to customers, not so great to employees",Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"The job wasn't really too bad if you don't mind warehouse work. The managers and the company itself is more worried about themselves than their employees. As a customer they do the very best for you, but as an employee they aren't nearly as hard working. "
Amazon,1fj24jfdnnq2f800,1,Terrible place to work,FC Associate I,"Amazon is a job for the desperate. You will be treated as a very replaceable piece of equipment, your training will be short and you will be treated like a child during it. If you last a few months amazon will attempt to get you to do as much as possible for free; they will ask you to run departments when your managers are gone, train and discipline other aa's who make the same amount of money as you, and they will ask you to do the jobs that break your back all while telling you it's helping grow your career.

Amazon,1fj1iemknu3rh800,1,Horrible Experience ,Fulfillment Center Associate,Most high school / middle school students have more understanding of basic human needs in comparison to the direct supervisors and managers we had at the open of FTW6. It was a terribly insensitive location to be roped into as employment goes. The breaks were 15 minutes long and took 7 minutes to walk to\xe2\x80\xa6 you do the math. 10 hour days of which 95% was on your feet and doing constant repetitive motion tasks. Don\xe2\x80\x99t leave your station to go to the restroom on a non-scheduled break or you\xe2\x80\x99ll be reprimanded. It was very toddler minded there.

They constantly nag you about safety before you start working but no one really checks or follow through with it. Short breaks and short is an understatement. You can\xe2\x80\x99t rest or else PAs or management will nag at you. If your scan rate is low, they tell you and then replace you with someone else.

I worked in a dock area transferring 10 foot carts, from one truck to another, that is a very physical and tiring, job and I believe that each job, should get paid a different pay rate, because some jobs are easier than others. On a sad note, there have been several workers who have been depressed and came to work, one particular worker was talking about things that were threatening, which I let the proper person know about it, and she did Nothing, about it, and then, I let another person know about it, then she went and talked to the worker, but that's really sad, their, main goal, is to focus on getting the job done. The love of the greater number of people has grown cold. "
Amazon,1fivdjpn8t516802,1,Work was awesome but the costumer support sucks!,wearhouse worker,"I\xe2\x80\x99m only writing this review because I was employed in DFW7 work was great I would come back if any issues arise. Yet my main issue is when I departed from the company they terminated me before my last day and paid me before the actual pay day which it Absurd. I thought I was going to receive the rest of my hours worked paid when pay day happened since pay period was still in effect. After I waited until Friday which is pay day nothing happened. I called costumer support they said wait 24-48 because payroll was still being processing. I waited nothing happened I called again they now made a ticket regarding this issue. They told to wait 2 days again and I will be receiving a call back for an update. Guess what! Nothing happened I called again they are now their saying they have to escalate it to a different department because my issue is very delicate and they will be contacting me for an update. I waited a week! No one called me now I\xe2\x80\x99m very disappointed. I called one last time just to see how they were going solve this, lady said there\xe2\x80\x99s no update and I can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything but forward notes letting them know is needs to be prioritized. I just can\xe2\x80\x99t believe that they have to make someone wait this long for something that\xe2\x80\x99s theres prove I worked in my punches and costumer service confirmed I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t paid for it. This needs to be fixed because people have to pay bills if the money was 20 dollars I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care but we are talking a whole week worth of pay your team should be well equipped to handle this issue no less than 7 business days but it\xe2\x80\x99s been 14. And No update or Resolution!!"
Amazon,1fivbse7ou26k802,3,Hardwork,Stower,"I applied at the peak of Covid and started close to a few weeks later. However communication was not clear between trainers and management which caused my termination. The environment is really warehouse there's no other way to describe it.

Amazon,1fiv1dnb83088000,3,Great company culture,"Systems Operations Manager, Information Security","Generally great company culture. The people are friendly and helpful and always willing to mentor.

They don\xe2\x80\x99t care about their workers. The time off is a joke. The jobs available are easy and if you work long enough there you will find that your co-workers are either really cool or super lazy. So lazy your manager forced you to pick up the slack. If you\xe2\x80\x99re good at what you do, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be promoted. Going to and from break uses up most of your break by the time you sit down.

Amazon,1fiuascfcu1n1801,2,Good money but hard work and poor company culture ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,I worked ship dock at TPA1 for a few weeks before wanting to quit. The work itself is extremely tiring. 10 hour days on your feet with 2 short breaks. Managers want insanely high productivity unless you\xe2\x80\x99re one of their favorites. Then you can sit around or wander all day chatting with no repercussions. PTO caps at 40 hours a year so enjoy your 4 days off a year. 
Amazon,1fiu1vvlgnpj5802,4,Pretty flexible ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"Amazon fulfillment center is a pretty cool job if you are not looking to advance. There are many advancement opportunities also for employees. My only gripe is working with a bunch of kids but Amazon is just a in the meantime job for me until I finish my schooling. Good benefits, the pay is pretty decent and the managers don\xe2\x80\x99t bug. The work is easy and boring though but you can listen to your playlist at least. You get unpaid hours to blow and can come and go when you want as long as you have time to cover missing times. The end. "

Amazon,1fitp446bhir4800,2,Too Good To Be True,Warehouse Associate,"You get a warehouse job without an interview or resume so of course that\'s a BIG RED FLAG. They train you in a day and expect you to know everything. From that moment they watch every thing you do all while deciding if they wanna keep you, terminate you or wait for you to quit.They micromanage instead of taking the time to train people longer and more effectively. They don\'t tell you what you are doing wrong they just scan your badge to alert it to leadership so they can micromanage you even harder. You don\'t know what you\'re doing wrong really ever. Instead of telling you what you need to do, they ask you questions in reference to what is suppose to be done to see if you know what you did wrong or what they assume you did wrong.Pay is good, this job might not be good for anxious people or people who need to interact or ""be human"" in a work environment. It is all about numbers not the workers. You are a robot basically. You stand and scan items all day and stow them for 10 hours. The worst part of all, if you need help you have to push a button that makes a LOUD  siren sound. There\'s no discretion if you need help everybody can see that YOU NEED HELP and the management gets annoyed if they have to come help you. I\'ve seen managers roll there eyes or walk over with an attitude if they have to come assist you. Money is not everything. If you wanna stand in one spot and be micromanaged and be a robot for 10 hours this job is for you and you will get great pay for it. If you prefer a job where you are valued and can actually get to know your co-workers and feel comfortable"

Amazon,1fislj0tpt4ef800,5,How to Succeed at Amazon,Fulfillment Center Associate,"You must be disciplined, focused, and flexible to weather standing daily for 10 hours. Be willing to learn any of the responsibilities in the building instead of restricting yourself to one task/one area. You receive what you put into the position. If you ask questions to correctly perform the task, love to learn, keep trying and exercising, wisely use your time when it is not as busy, and promptly arrive to work, you will succeed.Keep a positive attitude at all times and have thick skin. Stay away from gossip, remain focused, and do not tell your business. Be on time for everything throughout the day -- Amazon allows workers to clock in 5 minutes before work start and end time, lunch, breaks, and meetings. Remember you are being monitored from the time you arrive to the building to when you have departed for the day. Best of luck!"

I had medical appointments that HAD to be on specific days and at specific times. They won't excuse those times even though I attended work before and after. You have to use your accumulated time off. When you are hired you only get 10 hours of time off. Which is only one shift worth and for some it isn't even that. If  you are sick they don't accept a doctors note to excuse time you also have to use your accumulated time and if you don't have enough time to cover it and you go negative you are fired! If you are sick at work and they send you home you also have to use your time even if you have none and you are sent home anyways. We are in a pandemic and they want you to come to work sick. No way out of it. They will not accommodate your work schedule if you want to work Tues-Fri but they only offer Sun-Wed or Wed-Sat that's the only choice you have.

This is a new Building. Training was one Day, then you were left on your own. Manager was constantly on you about your productivity but never offered solution or help. Tried to make an Appointment with my GR rep and my Job Coach not available in that place. management lacks training how to deal with people.

Amazon,1fiqv6daknph6801,5,Love Amazon ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"Probably the best company I have ever worked for. I have been with Amazon now for almost 3years and they have always been there. Hr listens most of the time, the benefits are the best. The pay is great  and right now during peek we are getting paid extra to be at work. So that\xe2\x80\x99s a huge plus. Work is nice I get to mix it up and I am not always at the same place throughout the day so it gives my work day variety and I like that. "

Amazon,1fiqkid5jsa0o802,2,Unrealistic shift hours,sortation ,"They are not serious about retaining who they hire for the warehouse associate positions. I heard they get tax breaks for having high turnover and i\'m starting to think that\'s true. work at the delivery station on megacycle 1:20AM-11:50AM is reallly grueling! I thought the pay was ""decent"" until I worked there for a week. they definitely squeeze it out of you every last cent! lol as for the bonuses, once you\'ve worked there a week, you won\'t even care.. like, the money is not something that would hold you back from quitting.they really need to rethink the whole ""pick and stage"" portion and go back to the drawing board. if you want to work here, most definitely for for part time or what they call flex. I wouldn\'t recommend full time, there is very little time for you to recover and reset for the next shift, four days in a row. they need to do a donut shift option so that people who need that recovery time can have it."
Amazon,1fiqjf7jgsa0o800,3,I've worked for worse,Warehouse Associate,"All in all the work isn't hard, but it can be very tedious. The problem with moving up in the company is you either get a degree to move up to a position that pays the same, or you wait 4 years and you might get noticed"
Amazon,1fiqi8hm3npqa800,3,Fast paced and physically demanding ,Warehouse Worker,"The benefits begin on day one and include medical, dental, vision, disability, life insurance, paid time off, unpaid time off, vacation, covid leave and leave of absence if you need extended time off without quitting or using other time off options.  Unless you\xe2\x80\x99re physically fit and have lots of energy and willingness to move around, working here is probably not for you. The expected rates are high but as soon as you reach them, the expected rate increases. This would be a great place to work if I were two or three decades younger, but I am too old and my body is not as flexible and forgiving as it once was."
Amazon,1fiq907i6t4qn802,5,Fun job with opportunity for advancement ,Transportation Associate,As much as Amazon is portrayed as the \xe2\x80\x9cbad\xe2\x80\x9d guy I have to disagree. I have been with Amazon for over 4-1/2 years and have never had an issue. As with any company Amazon hires people to work and pays them a more than fair wage compared to other companies. I started part time and moved into a full time position. Amazon is flexible and I have good managers that care about my disposition as well as my future. Additionally there are plenty of opportunities for company paid training and schooling as well as advancement. 
Amazon,1fiq53m07npqa802,1,"You are just a number at Amazon, They like to rotate through workers",Engineer,"I was so excited to work for Amazon.....Till I got in and saw how it was ran. Crazy. They expect a lot from you or they will consider you not ""raising the bar""And be very careful. I noticed how many people were leaving every Friday. I questioned why this was happening. My management told me this was normal. I said not for most companies. Usually you don\'t have tons of people leaving all the time. Then if you question things you might get put on Amazon\'s famous ""PIVOT PLAN"" That is when you know you you are the target.DON\'T WORK FOR AMAZON!!!! "
Amazon,1fipr6qsmnph6802,1,Not a good work enviornment,Inbound Warehouse Associate,"They treat you more like a number than an employee, they really don't care about safety just productivity. The Managers and some PAs are less then helpful with questions or know how to do their jobs. They call overtime on short notice. They don't give you very long breaks they cut them short and overall a toxic work environment. "
Amazon,1fipqtlfju423802,3,Benefits were impressive ,Order Picker,"I liked the involvement the company had with mental health and helping ppl, but the pay just wasn't enough and lots of favoritism took place by management. I would have stayed at Amazon if they payed $20+ per hour then I could justify my horrible hours, missing out time with my family, and mandatory overtime. "
Amazon,1fipqp4f8o1jv800,2,Only worth staying for the benefits,Hazmat Waste Specialist,Benefits and vacation are good. HR policies are not administered fairly.

Amazon,1fio6bm5gnph6802,3,You’re just a number. ,Sortation Associate,The workload is overwhelming. The job is physically exhausting. The managers don\xe2\x80\x99t care about you. Management is constantly changing. They just want to make quota. Everything is down to the second. 
Amazon,1fio5irhlnph6802,3,less people,Packer,theres not a lot of people so it seems like a lot of work. theres a lot of favoritism. due to shortage of people they are always asking people to do a lot of OT.

Amazon,1finnpq52sa0o800,2,Customers over Employees,Sortation,"Amazon as a company is more customer oriented and focused that the employees are left overworked and frustrated at the end of every shift. The lack of control and disciplinary actions done for late trucks is ridiculous, the disorganization of certain members of management is frustrating and the lack of charisma and/or effort from other employees is sickening. Especially when you are a hard worker yourself and become the only backbone of the facility. Compensation isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough for the turmoil done on your nerves and body. Health care is only given to full-time employees which, for the people who live a while away, isn\xe2\x80\x99t an option. Definitely stronger consider a different profession unless a facility is 15 miles or less from you!"
Amazon,1finh3dibu48j802,4,"If you can keep up with the workload and stow rate, you are golden!",Warehouse Associate,"Working for Amazon as a Warehouse Associate is a pretty straight forward job like any other. However, the workload is more than than the usual workload you will find at other jobs. If you can keep up with the workload and stow rate, you are golden! Great pay!

Amazon,1fimpni12u48j802,2,Draining Physically and Mentally,Warehouse Associate,"Absolutely draining, long shifts, long weeks, mandatory overtime often and little paid time off. Very little wiggle room for needing time for issues involving childcare, injuries, illness, or anything else. You work when they say so or you lose your job. Holiday season sometimes make 60 hour weeks mandatory."
Amazon,1fimp1ss6u48j802,3,Fun work place,Package Handler/Sorter,I think the breaks are too short. I also don\xe2\x80\x99t like how they put in extra mandatory overtime hour on the shift during the week without asking us first. 
Amazon,1fimmgcf0t4lq800,1,UPT is a joke,Stower,Amazon give you hours to use but not enough. If you are working a 12 hour shift and sick you are messed up if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough time. If you go into the negative you are just fired. It\xe2\x80\x99s also hard trying to transfer to a shift that works. You have to also walk so far when you go on break. They also only give you 2 - 30 minutes breaks and one 15 minute break. That\xe2\x80\x99s not enough time to rest your eyes while working a 12 hour shift. Amazon do pay good but you can believe you earn every dime after a long day or night. 
Amazon,1fimhcmkpu48j800,1,very big turn over with staff,JLL,Very very  big  turn  over  with  staff .   Some  of  the  management  lack   people  skills.    Seem  to  be  always  trying  to  reinvent  the  wheel  with every   thing .
Amazon,1fimbfc1vnpqa802,2,Bad Management - STAY AWAY!!,Grocery Associate,"Bad management. Overworked and under appreciated. Managers don\xe2\x80\x99t care how long you stay in below zero temperatures. Zone Leaders (Especially the young ones) can\xe2\x80\x99t lead associates properly and spend half the shift talking amongst themselves. Don\xe2\x80\x99t dare question them or they\xe2\x80\x99ll retaliate by putting you in freezer! The Associates are the only good thing about working here (they all seem depressed when starting the shift.) It\xe2\x80\x99s a shame that everyone below the ZL title is treated like they\xe2\x80\x99re disposable. If your goal is to ascend to a higher position, don\xe2\x80\x99t bother with this location. They will always pick the under qualified \xe2\x80\x9cfavorite\xe2\x80\x9d"
Amazon,1filhvr4qnpqa800,1,Avoid if you can or at least have an exit strategy,Fulfillment Associate,"Benefits starting day one and pay that's above minimum wage are the perks. The jobs are mind-numbingly monotonous and have to be performed at a relentless pace that will grind your body into the ground. You're expected to perform repetitive movements at max speed for 10-12 hour shifts. Flaws in the overall design of the fulfillment process and constantly malfunctioning equipment have to be made up for by the employees. This is part of the reason there are so many injuries. Employees are taking shortcuts and performing the work unsafely to increase their numbers and avoid being written up or fired for not meeting their goals. Management looks the other way because metrics are the only thing that matters at Amazon. Your productivity is measured down to the hundredth of a second. Any time you spend not actively working is carefully scrutinized. Getting help from HR or the ERC is a lengthy process but repercussions for any underperformance are immediate and severe. Morale is low, communication is poor, and everyone is overwhelmed and exhausted. The turnover is constant and makes you wonder why they prefer the expense of hiring and training so many new employees instead of just making it a bit more tolerable for the people they could not run this business without. Those robots certainly aren't ready to replace us all. My coworkers are the best part of this place and they deserve so much more."
Amazon,1filh660bt4qn800,3,Pay is good nothing else ,HRA,There is a big hype about joining Amazon. They make you feel like you are going to be appreciated and there is room for growth. Only to suck the life out of you. Make you work hard and show good numbers and never promote you. 
Amazon,1filcmngut4lq800,2,It is what it is. I wouldn’t stay long unless I planned on moving up,Package Handler,It\xe2\x80\x99s a job. I would only recommend it if you needed a job immediately and had no other options. You will be a number unless you get in good with your managers. I suggest you do that. You may get optional time off when it\xe2\x80\x99s not busy which is nice but it sucks to hate your job so much you\xe2\x80\x99re constantly waiting for an opportunity to get out.

Amazon,1fil7doflt4qn802,4,Professional and Engaging,Program Manager,"Amazon is a good place to work. It is what you make of it. You have to strive hard to get ahead and they won't help you develop your career. You have to do that. However, I really recommend it."
Amazon,1fil6ge1hnph6801,3,Very Easy Job but no respect to their Employees,Amazon Prime Shopper,"I've worked at Amazon for about 3 years now as a Prime Shopper at Whole Foods. The biggest pros about this job is the fact that I can basically work whenever I want and the actual duties of the job are very easy. Cons of the job include the many inconveniences Amazon has made for employees to pick up shifts, meet their minimum hour requirements and all around tone-deaf changes to the policies of the job."
Amazon,1fikvtougt4lq800,1,Overworked and not enough time off options ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"I would only recommend to work at Amazon if you truly can\xe2\x80\x99t find anything else. The managers are constantly bothering you about your rates each hour. I worked as a sorter, my job was to provide work for the packers. The number one bad thing about sorting is, you\xe2\x80\x99re not allowed to leave your station to go to the bathroom. You would have to put on your andon which is a very loud alarm that goes off. And you have to wait for a manager or PA to cover for you. If you leave your station and come back, a manager will be waiting there to reprimand you. Every hour the managers are yelling over the loud speakers for us to work faster. You will constantly hear: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re at 15k! Come on guys we know you can do better!\xe2\x80\x9d We are basically working towards their bonuses which they claim they don\xe2\x80\x99t get. And if you think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to enjoy your days off, think again because you will be sent a text saying: \xe2\x80\x9cDue to the increase volume of work you will be required to come in for mandatory overtime\xe2\x80\x9d and sometimes that can require you to work an extra hour too. So don\xe2\x80\x99t even bother to make plans for the weekend.And the best part of it all, they do not accept doctors notes. So if you\xe2\x80\x99re sick and plan to go see your doctor, make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s on your day off. And if your time goes negative they will fire you. "

HR listens to you!!! the only thing I hated was the freezer. the shifts are typically 12 hours long. If you stay focused and get your work done it\xe2\x80\x99s a breeze. "

Amazon,1fijrpualu48j802,2,Warehouse worker jobs are terrible,Warehouse Worker,"Management treats you like garbage.  The work is easy but mind numbing the summers are hot and winters are cold. Coworkers form cliques and it takes a while to move up. Also they do random drug tests. There's always someone there to lecture you on how you're doing something wrong or if your break is over. There are some cool people to work with but no paid holidays at least not within the 1st year. Sometimes there's nothing to do and you end up standing around, walki g around or struggling to look busy. "

The pay is really good for a job that doesn't require any certification or degree. We were allowed breaks and bathroom breaks, and management seems cool. The only issue I had was with a fellow team member. Management/HR didn't seem to do too much about him because of seniority, and that's why I left. The break room offers employees vending machines, an arcade area, and coffee, which was nice."

I was told I had to wait so many days before I could request to change positions and was told even after submitting a request to change positions there would be no guarantee I would actually be approved to change positions. How can a company that supposedly prides itself on caring for its employees and calling it\'s workplace a ""family"" Force its employee to stay in a position where they do not feel safe?! "

Amazon,1fihtpk25sa4t802,1,Terrible place to work,Stower,Do not work here. These people do not care about your health or well-being. If you were throwing up at work they will give you a Pepto-Bismol and tell you to hang in there. They don\xe2\x80\x99t care if you\xe2\x80\x99re sick or if you have seizures. They don\xe2\x80\x99t care if you\xe2\x80\x99re dying on the floor.

You are expendable, they don't come out and say it but they treat you like a machine. You're expected to stay hydrated because they don't bother insulating or heating/cooling their facility, but heaven forbid you actually need to use the bathroom during a shift.

The 1 time I fell on a sidewalk really badly and I reported it they were very kind and understanding. The 2nd agent I spoke to, who took my detailed report, stayed with me for 30 minutes to see if I could continue delivering my block or not. So, in ALL my experiences with them, this has been a wonderful way to make SIDE money. For me, I WISH it could be something I could live off of alone, as there aren't enough available shifts in the morning to turn around and do another shift in the late evening (only got to do that 1 day on a Friday) (I hear some other people do though).

Management is the issue, there is no improvements on making the job enjoyable for everyone. It can be very depressing when you\xe2\x80\x99re constantly there for twelve hours.

I wish I had started with Amazon years earlier.  "

They cherry pick who gets to move up and they don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to care about tenure. If they want to get rid of you, they\xe2\x80\x99ll find a reason to get rid of you. Managers can see when you put in a shift or department transfer and when they do, they\xe2\x80\x99ll prevent you from transferring especially if you\xe2\x80\x99re good at what you do. And if you are really good at what you do, they won\xe2\x80\x99t let you learn anything else because they\xe2\x80\x99re so worried about their numbers."

I hope to extend my tenure with Amazon through upcoming promotions, advances, and opportunities. If there is one thing I would suggest, it would be that Amazon offers life/career coaches.  This would assist individuals like myself to discuss productive paths to aid in my success here at Amazon."

Amazon,1fi9pbd9eo1fe801,3,Great benefits but hard work,Packer,Great benefits but hard work. It is physically demanding. What I like most is they have flex schedule where you can pick your own schedule with minimum of 20 hrs each month. Insurance is cheap. You just gotta do the hard work.
Amazon,1fi9oiolru1sk800,5,Great pay. ,FC Associate I,"Amazon does pay you fairly for the work load they give. Management walks on egg shells when it comes to employees, which is a nice change since almost every job I've had I've been treated poorly"

As long as your output is within specification no one will bother you.  You will likely only talk to your manager when you are not meeting production expectations. 
Amazon,1fi5n4rg1t51r800,1,Run away ,HR Business Partner,Joining Amazon was the worse decision that I have done. Took the job during the pandemic for stability but should have stayed at my other job. Regional operation and hr leaders are toxic. No work life balance and on the calls they talk to you in a condescending way. If you public shame your direct reports you will get promoted and grow. Huge disconnect from a regional hr to a in station hrbp. Do not get weekend offs due to constant messages which creates a lot of anxiety. When I was hired I was told I would have to work 4 weekends one weekend day and now it is more than twice that during peak.

My PTO was taken without me using it then when I went to HR to have it corrected they said there was nothing that could be done and I was fired. Breaks are super short especially being on the 2nd floor and having to go through security by the time you get to your area for break or your car its time to go back."

Amazon,1fi3pqju7u1ns802,3,Great Pay but Repetitive ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"An Amazon warehouse is an okay place to work.

However, at the specific Fulfillment Center I was at, the training was sub-par and upper management consisted of folks only interested in rates and not the safety and well-being of the associates. Amazon states ""attack the process, not the person"", but the Area Managers at our FC were held to a double standard on that rule when rates diminished.  Also no OT pay due to being salary-exempt was pretty wack as AMs at my FC worked around 48 hours a week (peak is at least 60).  "

Amazon,1fi1ka2qsn52s801,5,Productive and fun workplace,Delivery Station Liaison,Great place to work. Management is up beat and helpful. Definitely room to grow within the company and advance. Learn something new everyday and the company seems to care about their employees.
Amazon,1fi1ihvq5o1fe802,3,Good pay for night shift ,Warehouse Associate,I really enjoyed finding loop holes in their system but overall you earn way more pay working graveyard shifts on weekends. Really easy work if you know how to pace yourself.
Amazon,1fi1816g0o1fe801,1,Great Name however Lacks Human Value,ASSISTANT AREA MANAGER – AMAZON DISTRIBUTION LOGISTICS,Employees at Amazon logistics are not treated with much value. Employees are Overworked. Clashes of personalities. No enough longer break for so much physical work.
Amazon,1fi14o930n52s800,3,"Warehouse job. Decent weekly pay, with benefits & 401k etc. ",FC Associate I,"Amazon offers great benefits to their employees.  Weekly pay, health & dental, 401k, stock options, life insurance, employee discounts.   Amazon also has a pretty cool employee app that you download on your phone that allows you to access your pay info, your health and insurance benefits info.  You can request time off in the app, look at /adjust your schedule, view your accured vacation time, unpaid time, and PTO right on your phone. You can even punch in and out (as long as you\'re in the building) through the app. I like that convenience.  If you wish to use accrued time, you can right through the app. You don\'t need to speak to a manager if you need to leave for the day, for example. You just enter how much pto or upt you want to use, and adjust your schedule accordingly. I find that pretty cool.  That flexibility is nice.  Just don\'t let your upt go negative or you will be terminated. Use it wisely. I\'m doing 4 days, 10-hour shifts. I am inbound stowing. Stowing is somewhat physically demanding. You will be sore, you will lose weight.  Being on your feet 10 hours, and moving back and forth does take some getting used to.  But it\'s really the mental game. Can you stand on your feet, doing one repetitive motion...all day? Everday? For 10 or 11 hours? If you don\'t like to work alone, with little interaction, stowing may not be for you. If you do like that, then this is right up your alley. Taking merchandise out of totes/boxes, scanning, then ""stowing"" said merchandise on robotic moving shelves that roll up to you. That\'s what stowing is. Amazon has strict quality control and"
Amazon,1fi0voldht51r801,1,Stressful and Low Pay,Manager,"You will feel stressed and associates will make more than you. As others have noted promotions are a popularity contest, many people who clearly do not do their job are higher rank than the hard workers. Its ok if you have no other options, but its easy to see why many people do not stay beyond a year."
Amazon,1fi0uute4n52s800,3,Growth opportunity ,"Lead Analyst, Critical Incident Operations",Great place for advancement. Management is iffy depending on the department. There are lots of cool company events and free lunches. They give out T-shirts and other prizes throughout the year.

Amazon,1fi0k1i9nu1sk801,3,Too much emphasis on targets,Returns Processor,Everything is monitored. Time off task is too strict. Pushing employees to not use restroom. Also because of the push to reach rates coworkers state each other in the back. Promotions are almost impossible 
Amazon,1fi0ij8t6sa0n800,3,Easy to apply and get hired.,Seasonal Fulfillment Associate,"Amazon could be a great company if they would hire Managers with experience and proper training in professionalism, work ethics, being respectful, structure and organizational skills. The pay should at least be $20 an hour to start, due to the type of work that is required there and long hours at some facilities. "
Amazon,1fi0bt73eu1ns800,5,No complaints ,Picker,Very easy and pay is amazing! You\xe2\x80\x99re standing all day but this company is all pros for me! I love it and the pay was worth the work! Remember to wear comforts clothing and shoes 
Amazon,1fi0b0kodn52s802,4,Pack,Package Handler,It was a lot of hours which is good if you need $$ but it will get you tired even on your days off so be ready to stand for 10-12 hours just buy some good shoes
Amazon,1fi08d87ho1fe800,3,okay,Picker/Packer,for when you have no place to go. worked there for a year and a half before getting stir crazy and leaving. Good thing is theyre always hiring if you need to jump into something

Amazon,1fi04u06vn52s802,1,Not good place,Associate,Long pay and i would not work here because the managers are bad and they don't care about you. They make you train 20 people a day that can't speak English and idk why
Amazon,1fi01d1qdt51r800,3,Fun,Warehouse Associate,"Repetitive job. Not so fun but good thing is you get to pick your own schedule (available). If you don't mind being on your feet all day long or have hours varied from daily and weekly, then you will have no issue working there. Management is not available when you encounter an issue.  "
Amazon,1fhvvgrlln52s802,1,Good luck ,Inbound stow,Good pay but you\xe2\x80\x99re definitely working for it. It was bad honestly they really don\xe2\x80\x99t care about you as a person and more if you\xe2\x80\x99re managing your given time.
Amazon,1fhvurv85sa0n800,2,If you enjoy non work life balance and prefer to be underpaid while those around you are promoted with less experience then its for you,Area Manager,Imagine a place that promotes over who is a yes man vs those who know the job. Imagine that a manager racks up so many complaints yet nothing is done and the manager is moved up. Imagine working 13 hours but being paid 10. Imagine you've helped launch buildings and are the most tenured there yet those around you with less experience are promoted ahead and now your direct boss. If you can imagine all that and like it then this is the place for you. If not keep scrolling. If a news headline states amazon is worried of running out of people that should be a sign of the attrition. 
Amazon,1fhvofa41u1ns802,1,It used to be good. ,Call Center Representative,Amazon has changed in so many ways in just a couple of years but none of it for the better! The same people are strung in and out of upper management roles to ensure that no one else moves us to make more money! Hope you like to not get raises and yelled at all day long bc that\xe2\x80\x99s basically all you do. Stuck at the same salary but you have to meet continuously changing metrics. 
Amazon,1fhvnp9mao1fe800,1,stop peeing in bottles,warehouse,need breaks and reasonable expectations. pay employees more and have provide benefits. the system is set up for employees to fail so the CEO can send people to space. 
Amazon,1fhvjvho4u1sk802,3,Amazing ,Machine Operator,"I\xe2\x80\x99m quite satisfied with my job. I feel seen, heard, appreciated & management makes sure I was acclimated to my role at all times. You can\xe2\x80\x99t ask for more than that."
Amazon,1fhviqao7n52s802,5,Pay was great,ICQA Problem solver,I worked with tge company for 2 years and i learned one thing if you are hard working person company will reward you for that. I had a great experience with the company.
Amazon,1fhvfag76u1sk800,1,very tough to get out of the minnow pond,Technical Support Associate - Virtual,"D2 customer service roll, it was unbearably stressful due to the way Amazon treats their employees in entry level rolls like a widget.  About 10% customers are jerks, just like in real life, but that 10% makes it miserable because Amazon sides with the customer.I wish I would have known that the #1 metric to measure success is whether the customer gives you a thumbs up, basically making the job a butt kissing contest. If you get 95% >, you get schedules preference, so it affects your career.  If you get below 90% thumbs up, you may be written up or let go.Biggest complaint from team mates is the pay and job was the same for people with 5 years experience in the same roll. They were nice, but I would resent new hires making the same as folks with 5 years experience.  It's like a minnow pond at that level.  After 15 months, I gave my notice."
Amazon,1fhvejmgno1fk800,3,okay,Returns Processor,its a warehouse job its okay at least you get some pto and vacation hours and are able to take leaves most other warehouses dont give you those benefits
Amazon,1fhvdv95uo1fk800,5,"Fun, laid back place to work at",Picker/Packer/Shipper,"Good hours, benefits, pay, and all around good people but a little disorganized when hiring people. Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s so many new people that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a station to work at, which is ok because you still get paid to be there and do nothing at all since it\xe2\x80\x99s not your fault but I would still like to be productive."
Amazon,1fhv9fhpko1fk801,2,Good for college students,Senior Human Resources Assistant,"If you are a skilled worker Amazon may not be for you. Pay is not comparable to what you would get outside of Amazon even though they say it's competitive. The warehouse is full of high school drama, favoritism among manager, and employee engagements by managers are not genuine. The overall work environment is very negative with little room for advancement unless your manager likes you. However, if you are a student Amazon may be a great place for you to work. They will work around your schedule"
Amazon,1fhv9ekb2o1fe802,2,Stressful af!you have no life working their overnight shifts.gets very tiring after a few months,Warehouse Sortation Associate,Stressful af!you have no life working their overnight shifts.gets very tiring after a few months.Management uses the good workers for specific tasks till they are either injured or depressed and had enough.Pay is ok but could be at least 2 dollars more for whats required.
Amazon,1fhv9dg72t51r800,3,Hard work ,Sorter,It was hard work being a sorter. The best things is that you can take time off(unpaid of course) almost whenever you need it. This location was kind of fun tho. Sometimes we get free snacks/food and they play music during the shift. 
Amazon,1fhv6ho1en52s800,3,Workplace is alright,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"You punch in, work, punch out and that's pretty much your day. Co workers and management are pretty good majority of the time. If warehouse work isn't your cup of tea, then you won't enjoy it as much."
Amazon,1fhuv26uku3bd800,3,Its alright ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,If you choose to work 4 days a week with 10 consecutive hour shifts with good pay then this will be the job for you. When I worked there it was a alright job 
Amazon,1fhuuefo6u3bd801,2,Isolation and a 10 hour work out ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"Leadership is all fresh out of college young 20ish year olds. They \xe2\x80\x9csay\xe2\x80\x9d they promote from within but I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen it done. Amazon has plenty of associates with degrees and experience if they\xe2\x80\x99d take the time to look at them, they want the chance to grow with the company. But if you come into the company a grunt, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what they treat you like, a grunt. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard work. At least if I die at work, the life insurance is decent. Seriously. They have vending machines full of Advil and Tylenol. Because they don\xe2\x80\x99t care that they\xe2\x80\x99re half killing you. Rate! Rate! Rate! "
Amazon,1fhuqb2pj3h9e000,2,Lots of micro-management and favoritism,Ramp Associate,"They love to get you excited and worked up about getting started. They train you on the basics, and anything after that, you're on your own. You have to beg for training, if you aren't a favorite, or a young flirt. You can submit an application to become a learning ambassador, but they'll never get back to you on it, and managers and process assistants will make up every excuse under the sun, rather than actually do anything productive about it. You can't complain or ask questions regarding how you are treated or how things are run, because most of the managers and others in leadership roles will defend themselves (and everyone else at the top) to the death, rather than actually listen. If you have a little orange vest, your opinions and concerns don't matter, and you are disrespected and treated like a child, regardless of age. They couldn't care less if you don't like it, because you really are just a number to them. If you ask for training, you'll never get it, yet they will go around asking everyone if they'd like to take on roles that require training (that you JUST asked for). If you are not interested in training, and you are lazy and always take VTO, you are magically first on every training list, and they put you on a pedestal. It will never change. Their job is secure with or without you, so why should they care?"
Amazon,1fhupsk28u3bd801,4,Preferable as a second job,Tier 1 Associate,"If you do not have bills to pay and live close to the facility, Amazon can be a great place to work.  People are generally friendly, and the managers I worked with seemed reasonable.  It can be physically exhausting, but I ultimately enjoyed the exercise.  Sadly, like too many other jobs, the pay is not enough to live independently.  Anyone who states that it is must be from a different area of the country because I can tell you first hand that even a week with lots of overtime barely cuts it in Central Jersey.  It is good that Amazon allows you to select which type of shift you work, but the company is too strict in terms of missed time.  This comes into play a lot during inclement weather, as the building barely ever closes.  Be aware that it is very easy to be terminated, for even minor infractions.  I would recommend only as a second job for extra money."
Amazon,1fhumpdtlu36a801,2,No comment ,Multiple Positions,"The employee benefits are excellent, but your work schedule isn\xe2\x80\x99t. There is no flexibility to change your schedule ever not even in emergency situations. Opportunities for advancement are nonexistent if you are a female."

I was fired while I was in the emergency room with a temperature of 104 degrees. if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t in the best shape of you life if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t very good at manipulating people if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t good at doing the same 8 1/2 seconds for 10 to 11 hours straight if you\xe2\x80\x99re OK with 30 minute lunch breaks where it takes 5 1/2 minutes just to walk to the break room if you\xe2\x80\x99re OK with only having 30 minutes to urinate or go number two a day then this place will be fine for you.

Amazon,1fhtph2ji2v63002,4,"Lots of freedom with schedule, but very little interaction with management",Warehouse Associate,"I worked warehouse with a flex schedule, meaning I could pick my schedule and work when it suited me, as long as I worked over 20 hours a month I was good. I loved that. Some days I just didn't feel like going in, and others I did. Sometimes I wanted the money, other times I didn't. However, the work was physically hard for the pay. You sit there with sweat dripping off your nose, busting your butt, video cameras over our shoulder making sure you don't slow down and you're thinking of Bezos raking in billions on your behalf. Management is almost impossible to get in touch with if there's a problem like your car breaking down on the way to work. It's all computerized/dehumanized/mechanical, there's no human connection or understanding. If you're an introvert like me, this can be a good thing. The PA's were cool here and always available when you were in the building.It's very noisy in the building, but like I said, if you're an introvert this can be a good thing.Advancement is very hard. They advertise around the building that they'll help you succeed, but mostly you're just ignored or swatted away by some HR person who visibly hates their job or has the stereo so loud they can't hear you. Team work is heavy at Amazon. Sometimes its great and other times you deal with a know-it-all peer with a barely-understandable accent on a power trip ordering you around and telling you what to do.But you know, I liked it there. I've never been in such good shape. I went hiking with friends and they were practically dead on the trail while I wasn't even winded. So, it has its good and"
Amazon,1fhtmr23o2v63000,4,Productive and fun workplace,Warehouse Associate,"Work here is very easy. They do a lot of cross-training (inbound / outbound). You will be sorting, scanning, and stacking. Lot of choices for your work schedule. Pay is decent."

Amazon,1fhtlbtg9o27b800,2,I Regret Working There,Sorter Associate,"Hi, if you are reading this you are probably debating if you wanna work at Amazon. Do not work at a Distribution Center, Fulfillment Center, or Sortation Center. Management are a group of recent college graduates with no previous management experience. If the warehouse is running slow, they come up to your face and ask you what is preventing you from going faster. They give you 2x10 min breaks in the shift and a 30 min lunch. They make a big deal if you go to the restroom, and tell you to go during your breaks. The warehouses are not climate controlled, so they don\xe2\x80\x99t have AC and just have some slow fans. The only thing that keeps you going are your coworkers since it feels like all of you are going through the same labor extensive experience. Oh, do not get me started with the schedule. They will have you start working overnight. The shift changed from 5am to 3am in a couple of weeks. 3AM, until 11:30am. Oh, and you will always see new trainees that will never go work there after one day of observing the warehouse environment. DO NOT WORK FOR AMAZON WAREHOUSES, if you really wanna work for Amazon, work at a customer service store or Amazon Locker. "
Amazon,1fhtjtrmqt50j802,2,Good for the money,Packer,"If you're just looking to make money, this is a great place to be. If you actually have passion for your job, this wont be good enough. There was one day I needed assistance and turned my andon lights for assistance, its like a tall light above your station that flashes and makes noise so management can know you need help. And the managers have a computer that flashes and makes noise as well, I sat with my light on for a whole 5 minutes because an item I needed to pack was missing and the managers sat a couple of feet away and ignored me, laughing and carrying conversation.

Stay Away!!!
Amazon,1fhsm08fh2v63002,3,Drudgery all day.,Sorter,"Took a job with Amazon because I kept on seeing their ads. One after another after another. I figured how bad could it be? Well, it was horrible and not that bad, yes, both at the same time. I worked in the sorting center. You took a package from a conveyor belt and then moved it onto one of 6 pallets that were nearby. Then repeated that activity for the rest of your shift. Mind numbingly boring. Physically taxing. Hot, loud, and dark environment. Simple task. Management didn't care about you. "

Amazon,1fhr9uqn2o26f802,1,Amazon.com Warehouse: horrible,Sorter,"I felt like working there has caused me trouble. They break the laws where I felt violated. They said that security is allowed to put their hands in our bags but my mother and I looked up the law on that, no security guard is allowed to do that because they are not the law. I\xe2\x80\x99m uncomfortable. I have a messed up spine and knee where they've told me to move faster and I\xe2\x80\x99m limping. The managers and HR are not observant of other\xe2\x80\x99s needs.  All the HR did was give me a paper of Amazon benefits. "
Amazon,1fhr9rkp2u4ba801,1,You're nothing but a number,FC Associate I,This company is the worst when it comes to employees. They claim to care about safety but the injury rate is what it is for a reason. The benefits aren't actually worth having because it's determined by some random person from a call center who doesn't know anything and causes more stress. The management is also clueless and favoritism is worse than the usual job. Not worth the pay or the pain. You're also forced to use an app that may not be functional. For being forced to use it so much it should be better. 
Amazon,1fhr4j8fnu3r4801,3,always something to do,Stower/Picker,meet good people but managers are annoying. you go in start your job immediatly. never stop scanning beause it will cost you. the pay is alright but you can always do overtime
Amazon,1fhr3f5l1u3r4802,1,"If you work hard, it means nothing, you’re just a number.",Fullfillment Associate,"HRs just don\xe2\x80\x99t relate or try to understand any trouble your having and do the bare minimal to shut you up.  Being the best or hardest worker gets you swag bucks, to buy Amazon merch, more like cheap clothing with the Amazon logo slapped across it.  Also it\xe2\x80\x99s over priced 35 swag bucks or more for a shirt that says Amazon and to acquire this made up currency you have to be in the top 3 of 40 people in your area at the end of the day, 1st place gets 4 swag bucks, what a joke no treating people like humans and all management does is stare at a computer and does absolutely nothing to help out the working employees"
Amazon,1fhr1u6bcu31n800,1,A company that will forget about you.,Ship Clerk,"Amazon does not care, they will not train you on the job unless you are a grunt on the floor. If you want a mindless job where you can walk around like a zombie and have the sudden urge to start drinking again, Amazon is the place for you."
Amazon,1fhr08s2hu31n800,3,Benefits is the reason to work here. Everything else will be a struggle.,Human Resources Coordinator,"Depending on your manager, you may be selected for a career advancement promotion but expect nothing. Benefits are great considering the pay which I recommend to folks needing a job or whom are students. "
Amazon,1fhqsho1ou31n801,3,"Aggressive Production Culture that Touts ""Safety"" as a Priority with Minimal Operations Support ",Workplace Health and Safety Specialist,"The culture here is absolutely focused on production. As a WHSS, your ideas are only worthwhile if they don\'t cost the company money. I understand that there is a point of diminishing returns, but when internal ergonomists present solutions that would drastically decrease known injuries and management declines all of the presented options following months of ""people first"", the true nature of the beast rears its ugly head. "
Amazon,1fhqrqcqvo26f802,2,Exhausting after awhile,Scanner,"I\xe2\x80\x99ve been one to kiss a**, so working there and trying to make myself a all-around employee as just self goal soon became a huge chore, with the fire/hire rate being as it is, and being someone with aspiration to learn everything there is to learn in the warehouse Managers and PA\xe2\x80\x99s soon became people I was always around.. which long story short got me terminated for little to no reason, which made the whole experience a slap in the face."
Amazon,1fhqrpvftu4ba800,2,it’s whatever ,Warehouse Associate,i mean nothing special. if you\xe2\x80\x99re not willing to move like they warn you don\xe2\x80\x99t even bother. biggest issues are 0 flexibility with schedules and poor mismanagement leading to overworking for some. and if you\xe2\x80\x99re stuck with slow people you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to compensate or be scrutinized.
Amazon,1fhqqcde0t3rt801,3,Work environment ,Pit Operator,If you are educated don\xe2\x80\x99t apply there .it\xe2\x80\x99s all about physical and working long hours .managers didn\xe2\x80\x99t even notice my existence for 5 month .Never get a one o one with my manger who o really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure who he is .I have a bachelor degree and o worked as a pit driver hated literally you picking items all day so boring no people interaction what\xe2\x80\x99s ever .pay is good but if you only wants to work as a machine to make money it\xe2\x80\x99s a really good opportunity for you 
Amazon,1fhqpudn1o26f800,3,Overall good place to work while in college,Inventory Control Quality Assurance Associate,"Overall not a bad place to work, i really the school accommodation, it helped me maintain a job while on college. There is plenty of other postions openeings, you just have to look yourself"
Amazon,1fhqpbbilu31n802,1,Management plays favorites,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Did not like working here. Management always played favorites. Work for fresh and was always placed in the freezer while the favorites never had to touch it.
Amazon,1fhqov8a9o16h800,3,Flexible hours for students,Customer Care Agent and Sales Advisor,"This job is great if you need a place to make $16 an hour and have it work with your school schedule, but once you're done with that there's really no room for growth in the company."
Amazon,1fhqo9d2cs7kp800,1,Don’t do it,Warehouse Associate,It\xe2\x80\x99s a nice job to get you on your feet at first but it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to move up and make more money along with the management treating you like just a number. I do not recommend working for Amazon for long if you do.
Amazon,1fhqo7k90o16h802,5,Good pay ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"Nice place to work, with good benefits and pay.             Warehouse up to date with air conditioning.                   A work day will feel like a day in the gym."
Amazon,1fhqn5naeu31n801,2,Do not work here if youre a student,Fulfillment Associate,"you already know working here is going to be the worst, it's just not worth the time and energy... the hours are crazy, and if you're a student un-doable. They won't let you reduce your hours unless you quit your job and reapply, no matter what they say online they just do not allow that.If you need money and a job fast I suppose this works out though."
Amazon,1fhqn0qbjt5al802,5,Productive and fun place to work.,Sortation Associate,Amazon is a great company to grow with. Your hard work will not go unnoticed. There\xe2\x80\x99s a ton of room for advancement. These facilities are updated with the latest equipment  
Amazon,1fhqglmh6u3r4802,1,Horrifying place to work where everyone hates everything.,Warehouse Worker,"One of the most toxic work environments I have truly ever been apart of. The work culture at Amazon is so strange it\xe2\x80\x99s not even funny. Management walks around with laptops yelling at you if you\xe2\x80\x99re going too slow. Nobody shows up for work, which in turn makes them call Mandatory Overtime constantly. The workers are super, super unfriendly because everyone is mad at how they are being treated by their colleagues and management. The tools you need to do your job don\xe2\x80\x99t work. This makes starting your shift off incredibly stressful, since you have to figure out a way to make the scanner work properly while having management yell at you to go get going. It\xe2\x80\x99s truly a sad place to make a living. It\xe2\x80\x99s also impossible to get noticed for advancement opportunities because the only thing they care about is their quota\xe2\x80\x99s. They do not have any time at all to develop employees or promote from within. AVOID WORKING FOR AMAZON AT ALL COSTS. ESPECIALLY THE PONTIAC LOCATION!!!!!"
Amazon,1fhqd3qjks7kp802,5,Good,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"It was a good company..... had work all day good company i enjoyed how i liked great job good people. Hadno real probl im This company has some of the best benefits to offer and they pay isn't too bad for someone without a degree or starting after high school. However, it can truly be a not who you know. but who you blow atmosphere when it comes to advancing. Management expects you to drop everything you're doing with your associates to complete everything else that makes them look good with little to no room to breathe."
Amazon,1fhq890j2u31n800,5,Fun workplace with great management and security on site.,Warehouse Associate,"great place to work, well my building is. management lets you know when you\xe2\x80\x99re doing something wrong and if you still need help they\xe2\x80\x99ll start showing you effective ways it worked for them. management is very cool and play music most of the shift. "
Amazon,1fhq6b9uts7kp802,2,Only good thing is benefits ,AFEJackpotSlamlineOpAmbassador/PS,No work life balance. They work you like a dog and management benefits from it by getting bonuses an promotions. Your time is monitored by a computer while your on the clock. Met is a must whenever they feel like throwing it on you. For what they ask from you is highly under paid!!! 
Amazon,1fhq5sbp2o16h801,3,"You are just a number, expected to hit rates",Associate,"You will work long hours (usually 10) doing the same repetitive task repeatedly for about 10 hours. Packing boxes, loading trucks, etc. There is barely anything to be learned here and advancement is usually among the favorites."
Amazon,1fhq2b7kao16h802,4,Flexibility ,Warehouse Worker,"Great company, opportunity for advancement is a available. Take advantage of the possibilities that are offered...educationThe company culture is inclusive. T"
Amazon,1fhpjvtc6s7kp802,4,It's a job,Associate,Overall it is ok. You need a good shoes not to tire your feet. Also a back protection belt saves you from back pain. Take a good care of your body. Good for young people
Amazon,1fhp9mbbju31n800,3,Payed enough ,Driver,Decent amount of money for the work that\xe2\x80\x99s required\xe2\x80\xa6. Good people to work with and get to know. There is pretty much always more hours for those who want to work 
Amazon,1fhp7lhq7o16h800,1,Don't do it,Sortation Associate,"If you like being expected to be on your feet all day long, have hours changed on you from day one, and not being able to talk to actual people when you have an issue then work at the warehouse. No work life balance. Just work."
Amazon,1fhp614ifu31n802,3,It’s okay temporarily ,Quality Control Specialist,"After a while it gets repetitive but if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking to move up or change positions, it may be a good fit for you. Mandatory over time is needed when they have to hit certain numbers."
Amazon,1fhp4ktofu4ba800,1,You are a replaceable machine ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"Training lasts essentially 2 days and your trainer will have likely only have 1 year of experience.  Much of the training is handled by on screen prompts at each station and they are often filled with out of date information. The work itself is simple but far from easy. You're expected to make the same repetitive motions hundreds of times per hour and the wear and tear adds up quickly. After one year, my doctor recommended that I see a sports therapist about the damages it was doing to my body."
Amazon,1fhp43kbqu3r4801,1,Got Fired,Amazon Warehouse Associate,Got fired for no reasonable reason. The pay don\xe2\x80\x99t match with the amount of work you put on. They don\xe2\x80\x99t care about their employees that\xe2\x80\x99s why they\xe2\x80\x99re always hiring. 
Amazon,1fhp2i2l8u3r4801,4,Productive,Sorter,"Very fun and productive workplace with multiple paths for advancement. Very good and relaxed work dress code, great pay for the work as well as great work life bakance."
Amazon,1fhp2dk8fu3r4802,1,Overworking job (warehouse sortation),Sortation Associate,"If you apply prepare to be worked like never before. This is a very physical job you are walking, lifting, pulling, pushing, bending your entire shift. Breaks are super short considering how you have to walk across the entire warehouse to get to the break room or outside. I am a part time employee. The managers literally watch you and asks you start returning to your station 5 mins before your break ends. You will sweat and have a good heart rate going I guess you it\xe2\x80\x99s good if you want to lose some weight. I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure if If the bonus is worth the toll it takes on my body. "
Amazon,1fhp1m63qu3r4800,5,Inventory ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"I love my job . I make sure the counts are accurate and what our inventory should be. I started as a stow associate.  It sucked. But I pushed through and came to work anyway. I bid out and got the position and shift I like. I'm not kidding,  I love my job. Best part, 3 days off. Yay.thank you Amazon for my job."
Amazon,1fhouk454t5al802,4,Busy and productive ,Warehouse Associate,I enjoyed my time here. Plenty of overtime and job flexibility! No room for advancement\xe2\x80\xa6..only PA and management roles. They show outright favoritism! It\xe2\x80\x99s based on who you know and not your work performance for someone who works hard and goes above and beyond! Excellent benefits!!! 
Amazon,1fhorpti0t3rt800,2,It was fun at first ,Warehouse Associate,"It was like one big college at first, it was so fun it was worth the pay until they got super strict & start over working people. It became quantity over quality. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen MULTIPLE people get carried out on stretchers in my 5 years of working for Amazon."
Amazon,1fhopqe29t5al800,4,"Easy job, Easy Money",Warehouse Worker,"All you have to do is scan packages to their right locationFirst week will be tiring but you get used to it afterwardsMake sure you GET THE ZAPPOS SHOES, coz you will be on your feet for 9hrsHave a good attitude and you will get through the shift"

Amazon,1fhole8ulu4ba800,3,Eh,Floor Associate,"It\xe2\x80\x99s alright if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind long grueling hours doing the exact same thing every single day for however long you choose to work there. Random side note I thought I was going crazy but if you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to lose about 10 lbs or more working there could certainly help, I\xe2\x80\x99m not the only one who\xe2\x80\x99s noticed this either."
Amazon,1fhogs13oo16h800,3,Decent place to work ,Amazon Warehouse Associate,I worked at a sortation center and it was alright. Decent pay but the flexing up and down are annoying. Be ready to lift and stay on your feet during the shift.
Amazon,1fhoebsj6u31n801,1,Awful!,Warehouse Fulfillment Associate,"I don\'t recommend working here to anyone. They promise you amazing pay, benefits and opportunity within the company but absolutely do not care about the people they employ. When i left I ended up with plantar fasciitus in both feet, carpal tunnel. They force mandatory over time on you but don\'t explain to anyone during the hiring process that its mandatory! They say it like ""there are over time opportunies."" They offer holiday pay then take it away after the holidays and back to the sweatshop wages. Your breaks are cut massively just trying to walk to a break room, might as well stay at your station. They expect EVERYONE (even those with special needs) to physically operate at the speed of the machinery. And if you don\'t you get written up and reprimanded. With the physical demands this job requires and what I\'ve seen this place to do their people. Avoid it! Work anywhere else!"
Amazon,1fhocvnppu31n800,1,Meh,Fulfillment Associate,Don\xe2\x80\x99t do it you get treated like a robot and don\xe2\x80\x99t feel any purpose. You can\xe2\x80\x99t even listen to music all you have to listen to is machines and you go crazy
Amazon,1fhocm8lls7kp800,3,"Atrociously managed, but normally enough work to get 40 hrs a week.",Warehouse Associate,"Not a very cohesive managerial operation. The managers barely communicate with each other about daily work requirements let alone the associates. Pay is fair enough, however benefits have dwindled, since I started. No work incentives have caused a huge lack of moral among most. "
Amazon,1fhocg8m1o26f801,4,productive and enjoyable workplace with great benefits,Transportation Associate,"Overall I had a good time there and would recommend it to anyone. I was lucky enough to have a great team. Also, a great opportunity to earn your CDL."
Amazon,1fhobcjsto16h800,5,Long boring hours but it goes by fast,Equipment Operator,My time working at Amazon was very confusing. The management team we\xe2\x80\x99re always on your back about everything that you did. But overall the warehouse was nice and clean.
Amazon,1fhobapcju4ba800,3,-It’s Okay ,Amazon Associate,"/Not a bad job, pay is decent but you can easily get burned out/annoyed by it. Depends on where you work really, management makes a huge difference, some make the job doable."
Amazon,1fhob518ho2if802,5,Loved,Operations Associate,"Amazon is an amazing company to work for and I would say it has been my favorite job thus far! They are super flexible with your schedule, you actually get to use PTO, and the management is incredible. "
Amazon,1fho8lma3u2l5800,3,Work ,Package/ Hazmat Handler,"Great for first time job seekers. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very physical place to work and it may take some time to adjust to the work load. Overall, it a place for opportunity and advancement. "
Amazon,1fho6psu6u1hk801,3,Productive and busy,Warehouse Associate,I didn't enjoy working at the company. I definitely felt like just a number to them. I constantly asked management to train me in performing other tasks so that I could improve my value and maybe I could get promoted. Never got the upskilling that I wanted. I left for a better opportunity.
Amazon,1fho1pggju2l5800,1,They don’t care about their employees ,Order Picker,"Suffered from a shoulder injury on the job and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything to make me feel better. They kept me in the same position. The men there were also perverts, especially the older ones. Would not recommend to anyone. There is no work-life balance. You are required to work overtime as what they described as \xe2\x80\x9cpeak\xe2\x80\x9d I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anyone who enjoyed their time at Amazon. "
Amazon,1fho0ufq3u2l5800,3,Very stressful job when I worked there,Fulfillment Associate,This job was very physically demanding and mentally draining. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even give you time to go the the bathroom or it would be TOT not to mention the warehouse is huge and takes 10 minutes to walk there and back especially if you have been on your feet all day
Amazon,1fho0sathu2l5802,3,It’s okay,FC Associate I,It\xe2\x80\x99s not the best place to work but it pays bills. Work is tiring and strenuous on your physical and mental health. Supervisors are okay but not motivating like they should be. 
Amazon,1fhnu9dhut49t800,3,Decent place,Warehouse Worker,Amazon warehouse isn\xe2\x80\x99t a bad place if you are willing to put the work in. It\xe2\x80\x99s good for the pay but bad for the work. There definitely is room to grow there. 
Amazon,1fhntgfkjn518802,3,Easy job,Picker/Packer,"Nothing to really complain about. You\xe2\x80\x99re going to riding your machine by yourself so you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about management looking over your shoulder, but you will get bored fast. The only thing is your co-workers will get impatient and will try to rush you out the aisle."
Amazon,1fhnnsfpon518802,3,it’s a job. ,Warehouse Associate,it\xe2\x80\x99s a job. it\xe2\x80\x99s what you make it. the best part of the job is going home. too many chiefs and not enough indians.  everyone wants to boss the next person around. 
Amazon,1fhnl9u11u1hk802,2,"Favoritism, one person can do something and it’s ok, if someone else does it it’s not allowed ",Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"Amazon is definitely not for everyone!! If you\xe2\x80\x99re of the younger crowd they treat you great and move you up, if you\xe2\x80\x99re older they work you like a dog because you have better work ethics than the younger ones! Work life balance sucks, they don\xe2\x80\x99t care if on your day off you have something planned, if they call mandatory overtime you better be there, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s every week. This place is ran like a sweat shop and they wonder why good people don\xe2\x80\x99t stay!!"
Amazon,1fhn9ncpfo2if800,5,"Great job, great people",Selling Partner Support Sr.,"Everything you have heard about Amazon as an employer are true, the good stuff anyway. I was terminated without cause or warning. There is an appeal process in place which I am navigating currently."

Pay and benefits was ok and HR would try to make the job less miserable with activities or dress up days. I would recommend if you need a full time job but your experience would probably very"
Amazon,1fhn412n8o2if801,3,Alright fun coworkers,Dock Worker,I loved the people hated how they treated us like slaves.  Everyone always looked tired. Standing and lifting for hours. I wished people knew how depressed you can be working there. The pay is pretty decent though. 
Amazon,1fhn03voot66d802,4,Good company to work ,Warehouse Worker,"Too much work load but still a good company to work for a fair package. If you are looking for a stable job, get your work done on time from 8 to 5. Such a good choice "
Amazon,1fhmt34gnu1hk801,3,Great for short amount of time,Warehouse Worker,It\xe2\x80\x99s a good place to be to save up money then get out. The work is fairly easy very repetitive but not hard to do a quick three months then move on to something better. 
Amazon,1fhmp9evto2id800,2,Difficult place to advance with brutal shifts. ,Stower,During the hiring process you\xe2\x80\x99re told how easy it is to move up in the company. This is far from true. Unless you get very close to your supervisors you\xe2\x80\x99ll get overlooked. Consistently making your goals will keep management off your back but you\xe2\x80\x99ll be constantly pressured to make lateral moves to more difficult jobs- More responsibility for the same pay. Injuries are commonplace but typically ignored. Shifts are too long for the type of physical work that\xe2\x80\x99s required. When peak hits and you\xe2\x80\x99re scheduled for 6 straight 12 hr shifts for 5 weeks in a row you\xe2\x80\x99re left with little time to recover from the work week. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take long to realize employees are extremely expendable to those in charge. Overall I soured on Amazon during my time there. 
Amazon,1fhmp49depiba802,4,So far so good,Grocery Clerk,So far I enjoy working at amazon. The online hiring was pretty seamless. The training was easy as well. I am excited to learn new things and work hard. 
Amazon,1fhmnih1vpiba800,4,Decent Benefits ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,The long hours are definitely not for the faint of heart but you have to do what you have to do. Four work days and three off days. Wish pay was better. 
Amazon,1fhmi8t7gt49t800,1,The workplace can be pretty toxic and demanding,Amazon Associate,Most managers don't care about you. They will give you the most demanding task and require that you keep a certain rate. You do the same thing for 11 hours a day. Honestly felt like my brain was melting.
Amazon,1fhmgsn2vt66d800,5,Great,Warehouse Associate,"Awesome place great place to work People who eat meat (on average) experience lower levels of depression and anxiety compared to vegans, a meta-analysis found.

Amazon,1fhmgm4dsn518802,5,Its a job,Sorter/Package Handler,"New employee  get paid more than employees  that have been there for years. Not enough supply to do your job.  Easy hire, flexible  hours, good benefits.   Overcrowded. "

Amazon,1fhm8avktpiba800,3,Not a bad place to earn pay but almost no advancement in role,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Overall wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bad place to work but the management only thinks of you as a number and there is almost no job security. If you go even a minute over your break they dock you for an entire hour.
Amazon,1fhm45rbgu2l5800,1,High employee turn over rate,ICQA Associate Problem Solve,"Amazon hires people very easily, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t care about their employees. They work you extremely hard and don\xe2\x80\x99t pay enough for how hard they work you. Employees are expendable. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t keep your rate up, they have new employees ready to replace you. They don\xe2\x80\x99t care about you or your health, they only care about making their numbers."
Amazon,1fhm1sq2vs9uh800,5,Just a breezy day,Inbound Stower,If you want. Steady work and independency this is the company. Staff is helpful. Wage was fair. Overtime is offered. Call off is easy paid time off vacation pay and upt

Amazon,1fhl8sncmn518801,2,Good pay long hours,Warehouse Associate,Job gets very repetitive and tiring. Managers show strong favoritism. HR seems to just want to fire people when they can and replace them as usual. We\xe2\x80\x99re disposable.

Amazon,1fhkrmpkhu2l5801,3,"Not much to say, it's Amazon",Fullfillment Associate,"Repetitive work, moving up the ladder is based on who like who the most. Treated more like a number rather than a person, if you happen to be paired with a great manager make the most of it."
Amazon,1fhkqsd8lt49t800,5,Productive,Stower/Picker,Great across-the-board. The people don't really both you like a typical warehouse. You interact with Rf guns or computers mainly. Some of my co-workers work robots.

Amazon,1fhj7fahlu1hk802,1,Sucks,Area Manager,This job really sucks a lot. A lot. The managers are so rude and they think they can make changes without informing everybody. I would not recommend anyone to work here. 
Amazon,1fhj33127o2if800,1,Just another number ,Warehouse Associate,Benefits are great and pay is decent but that\xe2\x80\x99s where the pros end. You are nothing but a number here and are treated as such. They are always putting workers in competition against each other as a way to increase productivity with back breaking work. 
Amazon,1fhirrn92o2id802,3,Straightforward roles,ICQA and Outbound Associate,"Pros-- Site managers responsive, supportive and demonstrate efforts to provide pleasant workplace culture.

Amazon,1fhib8oi9t49t801,2,Flexible schedule,Item Picker,Never know if you are going to get any hours of work. You rely on the speed of your computer to pick up shifts. Amazon says you can work up to 33 hrs then shuts you off at 25 hrs for the week. Often you are lucky to get 15 hours.
Amazon,1fhi9m03co2if800,3,Good experience👌🏼,Part-Time Warehouse Team Member,"Great employees and people you can meet while working there jobs were pretty easy, good pay, a lot of vto and night shift overtime offered, and just overall a pretty cool place to work also sometimes they would serve free food for lunch and provide employees with Vest, Amazon shirts, gloves, box cutter, and clip for tags"
Amazon,1fhi05q45t49t802,2,Unethical company worst experience I've had with a job ever,Former Deliver Driver for 3rd party Amazon- affiliated delivery service,"The actual driving company is located in a trailer with internet access, in the middle of the parking lot of the far offsite Amazon Warehouse. They don't let you know this til after you went thru the training and have committed to the initial so called 'flexible work hours' offer. There is one 'manager' to guide all of the drivers (20+) drivers each day and, you do not know them... you dont know anybody at the company.The workdays(cons) - monotonous, substance devoid, stressful The workdays(pros) - radio b/t whenever, source of incomeFundamental Flaws: calls and annoying messaging on personal phone constantly when not working. the ad posted as choose your own hours location is misleading, ad posted was misleadingemployee to employer communication accuracy/integrity issues (constantly told to lie about things - managers would lie to me about things)distasteful relation from managers to employeetheir whole ecosystem is very flawed; it feels rushed. stressful workdayyour life at risk behind the wheel to pay you-- in reality, a fraction of what the actual work being done is worth. Automation out the wazoo, make the whole thing feel robotic, depressing, lonely, and dividedDespite the pay, I would not want to do this again ever nor would I ever recommend this job. I would seriously consider passing this one up and spending some more time digging to find something better in the long run. Overall this has to be the worst experience  ever had in a workplace. "
Amazon,1fhhucoh8u1hk800,4,It’s an ok job. Nothing crazy ,Amazon Shopper,Overall it\xe2\x80\x99s a good job. It\xe2\x80\x99s also very flexible and you can choose the shifts you want to work. All you do is shop for people. Some orders can be big and stressful but managers are willing to help you also other co workers as well.
Amazon,1fhhmkhkls9uh802,4,Productive and fun place to work,Amazon robotics associate,Its Good to be working there. They paid fair but sometimes you need to work out of your working area due to non availability of workers. Overall it's my good experience to working with Amazon so far..

Amazon,1fhhaosrnu2l5801,1,Lots of fear.,Associate,"Most everyone on the floor is scared of losing their job for simple mistakes. A young mother got fired for using the bathroom too much. The benefits are not terrible but, you will probably get fired before you can use them. Amazon can offer great benefits because no one is allowed to use them."
Amazon,1fhh8e6rau1hk800,5,Great place,Customer Service Manager (CSM),"Worked here remote for about 22 months. Great opportunity, work-life balance and pay. Benefits were amazing as well, which started the first day I started as well. Did not really advance the way I would have liked but that may be more a me problem than company problem..

Amazon,1fhguvq9vn518801,2,Not the best place to work.,Warehouse Worker,I worked here for a brief period. The hardest part of the job was the back breaking labor ;I worked until my feet were numb.  There was a high amount of turnover. Managment was competent enough. The pay is better than minimum wage but not anywhere I would want to stay long term. 
Amazon,1fhgs0tfrn518802,5,Productive fun place to work.,Problem Solver,They recognize hard worker.  I exceeded rate weekly and was moved to problem Solve. Managers and fellow employees were friendly and helpful.  Great place to work for productive people.
Amazon,1fhgrrs6hu2l5802,3,Stepping stone,FC Associate I,"Amazon is a good place to be if you're in between jobs.  Some people make it into a career but the majority of people don't last more than a year or two. Turnover is ridiculously high.  The work is very easy, but it's very hard on the body. You're on your feet your whole 10-12 hr shift with two 30min breaks.  Their benefits package is very good and cheap."
Amazon,1fhgo7jmvu1hk802,1,Dangerous Work Environment,Picker/Packer,Carting around pallets with no motorized equipment. This company will work you to death. Highest injury rate % in the US. Plow horses are treated better. Management is inept and does nothing their whole shift.They treat the elderly like garbage and with no respect to anyone's disabilities. This company doesn't care if you drop dead on the job and if you do you will be written up. 
Amazon,1fhgkqlplt49t800,3,Ok,Fulfillment Center Associate,"Things have definitely changed since I first started there in Late 2018. The management  is different. They 'promote' (Kids) with no experience to higher positions. I understand there needs to be a career ladder....However, that is very disappointing to see this practice.Some let this practice ..... 'go to their heads' if you will."
Amazon,1fhghtcs6n518802,1,very isolating,Seasonal Employee,"the job is incredibly lonely and you will be on your own for the most part unless something dramatic happens, managers are hardly present or constantly hovering"
Amazon,1fhgfn1nqu2l5802,3,"Working at a sort center has been one of the easiest job I’ve held, and the pay is alright.",Amazon Sortation Associate,"I work at a sortation center, and the workload is mostly very low (outside of peak), the culture somewhat laid out and the work flexibility excellent. In terms of the job itself, scanning can be pretty tedious but there\xe2\x80\x99s almost always other tasks to do and roles that you can be trained for. Management has been mostly understanding of my concerns thus far but don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to be praised or promoted. The company\xe2\x80\x99s management is very impersonal and you can sometimes forget you even have a boss. HR is also terrible to work with, and Amazon itself will find any way possible to screw you out of the perks you deserve, eg shift premiums, parental leave, or holiday pay. The company also refuses to excuse most hazardous weather conditions meaning there may be times where you have to choose between your job or potentially your life. On the flip side, most of the people there are pretty cool and work is mostly laid back. As far as I know this laid back attitude is mostly exclusive to sort centers. "
Amazon,1fhgev5ois9uh800,4,Fast paced job. Lots of energy needed. ,FC Associate,Four days on three days off. Mandatory overtime can push you into a sixty hour work week.  Sixty hour work week during peek season (mandatory). Lots of available overtime. 
Amazon,1fhg6h6hpn518802,2,"Decent Money, no work/life balance ",Warehouse Shipping Associate,I worked in the shipping department for 7 months. It was not difficult mentally but physically it was hard. The pay and benefits were pretty good. The management was ineffective for the most part. There is a lot of mandatory overtime. Sometimes after working nonstop for 10-11 hours I could barely walk to my car. I did meet some very nice people. If you are young and strong you could grind here for several years and make good money.
Amazon,1fhg64tkbo2if802,1,Toxic and hostile place,Warehouse Associate,"Management consists of people younger than 30 in  most cases who have been made a manager simply because they have a degree.  HR is worse, and even more clueless.  Hostile and Toxic place to work.  Every shift begins with threats and brow-beating and being told what not to do OR ELSE!!!!"
Amazon,1fhg4v1s1o2if802,3,Get your paycheck and  benefits but have a plan,Packer/Shipper,"Medical benefits on your first day. Use your benefits asap. They have the best coverage!Very physically demanding.  Mandatory overtime especially around the holidays. No excuses you can't get out of those. If you want to move up be vocal about it. It is very possible. Managers are very pleasant and down to earth.Get your paycheck, use your medical and get out before your body says No! This should not be a long term gig."

Amazon,1fhg2dn30s9uh800,2,Not for everybody,Amazon Warehouse Associate,This job isn\xe2\x80\x99t for everybody for sure. If you\xe2\x80\x99re in the position where you HAVE to make money then this is a good last resort. The pay is almost worth the hard work but not worth it enough for me. 
Amazon,1fhg0rsbju2l5802,5,The people and processes are amazing!!!,Sorting Associate,"As long as you are someone who is a hard worker and you can follow safely rules you'll do well. If you stick with them, and you'll soon get a great promotion."
Amazon,1fhfmr20gs9uh802,3,productive but very stressful,Amazon Delivery Driver,not a bad job if you wanna make just enough money to pay bills and have just a little left for everyday expenses. they don\xe2\x80\x99t really allow you to get overtime. they rush and expect you to finish really fast without many or any breaks through out the day. no room for advancement. 
Amazon,1fhfibfagn518802,5,I enjoyed working for Amazon,Amazon Warehouse Associate,Not a bad place to work if you enjoy doing things are your own and don't get bored easily. The days are long but the pay and benefits are good if you get hired on full time. 
Amazon,1fhf5cfkgu2l5802,4,Good place to work // part time ,Floor Associate,I worked at hou1 // It was an easy warehouse job being that the shift was only 4 hours 5 at the max the only thing that was irritating was management especially when the volume of work for the day was a high number 
Amazon,1fhf4hi01o2id802,3,Seller support,Selling Partner Support,Had anxiety before I took every call because the three weeks of training was insufficient. I gave it four months  to assess and feel if I felt more secure in my knowledge and I wasn't. They had insufficient helpline response as well (10m wait on a good day which is miserable while on the phone with someone..and up to an hour wait on other days)
Amazon,1fhet2adopiba802,1,Very stressful,Field Transportation Lead,"Expect too much for the pay offered, constantly get bothered while at home off the clock barely get paid more than my employees.

Amazon,1fhet04ajpiba800,1,Poor workplace,Warehouse associate,"Unless you need money, this is not worth it. You learn nothing. Poor environment. Unfriendly staffs (we're all there to just pay the bill so what do you expect?) You'll just be trading your time away in order to survive in this society. "
Amazon,1fher17b2u1hk802,1,Terrible job,Delivery Driver,They just don\xe2\x80\x99t care about you. It\xe2\x80\x99s a 3rd party delivery company who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate the hard work employees put in on a daily basis. The pay was alright but nothing over the top. 
Amazon,1fheqm6oeo2if802,5,Work ,Warehouse Associate,"You can never complain about making too much money, it\xe2\x80\x99s a love and hate relationship. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work there too long though it\xe2\x80\x99ll drive you fuking crazy "
Amazon,1fhej71mgo2if802,4,Fun workplace. Pay could be better.,Sortation Associate,Sometimes felt like their was high school drama going on between co workers but I stayed out of the drama. Some managers played favoritism and let specific people get away with certain things. Fun work environment in the beginning though. Music playing and clean work stations. 
Amazon,1fheeacnso2id802,1,Don’t recommend unless your desperate ,Warehouse Associate,"I\xe2\x80\x99ve been at Amazon for a few months. It\xe2\x80\x99s definitely not for everyone. Long hours on your feet I\xe2\x80\x99m used to that but if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t, be prepared. Good starting pay but not room for advancement  and managers literally don\xe2\x80\x99t care about you and won\xe2\x80\x99t even take time to learn your name. "

Amazon,1fhe8sikst66d802,2,Was ok,Amazon Warehouse Associate,I had a good experience working in a warehouse for my first time. coworkers are very friendly and the staff was OK. I have gained a lot of knowledge and experience by working in this warehouse.
Amazon,1fhe1qrims9uh802,4,Decent for the moment if u really need a job ,Warehouse Associate,Hard work on your body. Need a lot of rest after. Pay isn\xe2\x80\x99t bad better then most places paying below minimum wage. If your not fit or well motivated this would be a hard job to you. 
Amazon,1fhdvnl8io2if800,4,Will hire you,Transportation Associate,"A typical day has lots of structure and follows policies.  I learn a lot about transportation.  My management is very helpful, although there are a lot of managers in the building which I don't have to work with but may have different goals than I do.  The culture is great with lots of food given to us.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with deaf ears.  I get tired of saying the same thing to the same people and nothing ever changes.  If people could listen and respond accordingly would feel a lot happier.  The most enjoyable part of the job is having a good day or just finishing the day."
Amazon,1fhdt66atnpdo800,5,Great place to work!,Associate,Not stressful; management understands professional development goals. There are opportunities to move internally between departments which is very appreciated!
Amazon,1fhdj9h43t66d802,3,Tedious and ongoing ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"If standing in the same place for 12 hours is your idea of fun, then this is the employer for you. They tell you from the beginning that you will have opportunities to work in other areas but if you don\xe2\x80\x99t become friends with the leadership, then you won\xe2\x80\x99t be going anywhere. "
Amazon,1fhdgi4ues9uh802,2,Very clicky ,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"Very high school like, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend working in the warehouse there for anyone unless you are one of the \xe2\x80\x9ccool kids\xe2\x80\x9d or know one of them lol lol"
Amazon,1fhdbtugln518802,3,"Decent money, solid benefits",FC Associate I,"Overall, Amazon has been a decent place to work. It's a great way to get your foot in the door to learn or hone skills. Generally there is room for advancement unless you are too valuable to replace. Management as a whole can vary greatly due to the high attrition and constant shuffling of managers. I've been with Amazon for roughly 4 years and gone through around a dozen or so AMs, several OMs and even a few GMs. Every manager will cause large swings in morale and working conditions due to lack of strict guidelines. Best advice I can give to fresh candidates is to work at Amazon. When you do, make sure you use everything availabe and every opportunity to advance up the ladder or to learn new skills. Take every class you can that interests you and use all the internal resources to improve yourself. If you haven't been able to move up the ladder within 2 years, it would be best to move on to another company."
Amazon,1fhd997oru1hk802,5,Fast pace,Sorter,Go in with the right attitude take advantage of Zappos shoes makes a big difference during your shift. The job is what you make it... Good people Good job
Amazon,1fhd38siqu2l5800,3,It depends ,Amazon Associate,"Your experience depend on what department you work in every department has its good and bad. Personally, shipdock if you work hard they make you work harder. It can seem bias at times & they move you around constantly some days."
Amazon,1fhcsjkrto2id802,2,My feet hurt working here,Universal Inbound,I mean they pay good but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard labor working at the Amazon warehouse and I would never ever do it again although the pay was pretty great but it\xe2\x80\x99s not something long term unless you can do warehouse work for long periods of time
Amazon,1fhcias8et49t802,2,eh,Fulfillment Associate,"at first it\xe2\x80\x99s great but the expectations of employees is near impossible. they want you to be the fastest but don\xe2\x80\x99t train properly and then when you finally feel like you have a pattern, they change up."
Amazon,1fhccocrps9uh801,3,Exhausting,Warehouse Associate,"Your just a #Pay is better now, but the physical aspects of the job will probably cripple you in your old age. Most employees fun to work with but your feet will hurt no matter how young you are."
Amazon,1fhca6fdou1hk802,3,The pay is good,Warehouse Associate,"The pay is good, and you get paid weekly. Although, it's really draining to work 10 hours a day in a warehouse. Whether is be mentally or physically, you get used to it after a while. "

Amazon,1fhc5vnhit66d800,4,Great place to work really hard,Technical Account Manager,AWS continues to grow and to hire and there is always more work to do than people do do it.

Amazon,1fhc5hg5gnpdo801,3,It was okay ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"It was okay. The pay was pretty good. I was in the trailers so that sucked because it was heavy work. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the best, atleast in my experience. Okay hours"
Amazon,1fhc0qg1eu2l5802,1,Terrible place to work in and only recommend if you want your back broken,Warehouse Associate,"Working as a warehouse associate for Amazon is one of the only jobs that accepted me as someone with no previous work experience, but that was the only plus. The benefits are ok if you are full time, but the back breaking work isn't worth $15 an hour. The job is very intense and repetitive and you only get a 30 minute break (unpaid) for the whole 8 hour shift. Under normal circumstances, that is ok- but this job is very labor intensive and is similar to doing CrossFit for 8 hours. You will feel tired at the end of your shift and you will sleep for the rest of your day off. You will inevitably become their sl*ve. Oh and the management is complete cr*p at their job as they are disorganized and overtly rude for no reason."
Amazon,1fhbv4un3t66d802,4,"Good money, a job not a career",Picker,"I worked night shift so it;s tough to get acclimated with the schedule. The pay is good especially on night shift, but it is a very bureaucratic company. "

Amazon,1fhbp2ctut49t800,5,Great place to work !,Packer and Sorter,"What I liked about working at Amazon was the fact that I felt like the company cared for their employees. One thing for example is their benefits they offer, by far one of the best benefits package offer compared to others."
Amazon,1fhbnr725o2if802,3,Hard and fast paced work ,Warehouse Worker,Don\xe2\x80\x99t work here if you are not up for non stop working for your entire shift. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard work. Issues with clock in punches. Everyone is super friendly and helpful though. 
Amazon,1fhbhjap4s9uh802,2,Not a Good Company!,T3 Yard Specialist/ T1 Inventory Specialist,Number obsessed. People aren\xe2\x80\x99t treated with respect and are expected to work like robots. Heavyy on favoritism. Most of the time your promised promotions that they give to butt kissers or kids straight out of college. HR don\xe2\x80\x99t do their job. Everyone is intimate with everyone so that makes the work culture toxic in whole.
Amazon,1fhbhdsmoo2id802,4,I had a great time but YMMV,SDE Intern,The teams at amazon have very little to do with each other so you get drastically different experiences depending on who your coworkers/managers are. Personally mine were great. 
Amazon,1fhbe8m69u2l5802,3,Overall Operations isn't sold to intern's like it should be,Area Manager in,Overall Amazon was a decent experience. The recruiters just oversold the actual things I was going to be doing. Most of the summer I was just managing associates.

Amazon,1fhb9j6gut66d802,4,Good starting place ,Process Assistant,"If you are just starting off in the warehouse/logistics environment, this is a good place to start.

Management on  nights have become obsessed with numbers to push out, little to no room for safety or quality. Power and greed runs this building. If you don't have a tough skin you will never make it here. Work is repetitive but easy as long as you hustle. Talking is a big NO! Your opinion and or ideas are just that. Micro managed to to full extent. Hustle and go home. Money and benefits keep me here. "

Management is great and the people were also cool. It\xe2\x80\x99s an easy job and it\xe2\x80\x99s entertaining looking at all the shirts. A downside is that the hours are long and late at night you want to die from boredom.
Amazon,1fha1aivbu2l5802,2,Not fun at all,Warehouse Worker,Very hot and stressful. Repetitive work and they will question u if you go to the bathroom. Literally feels like you\xe2\x80\x99re in prison. It would b better if they had Ac And we could do different things throughout the shifts

Amazon,1fh9jqtevs9uh801,1,Not a fun place to work. False job advertisement ,Packaging Associate,"Amazon is not an employee friendly company.  They will use you and suck you dry. The take off policy is so anti employee. God help you if you get sick for any period of time which requires you to take off for a few days. Thier policy is terrible and they will terminate you with no fair consideration . Also, bad management "
Amazon,1fh9g03dvt49t802,4,You get what you put into it,Manager,"Just like the title says. Willing to put in the work and display their Leadership Principles and you can go far. Its lost its small feel, teams across the company no longer communicate causing poor experience for those on the front line of the company. "
Amazon,1fh9dba59n518802,5,"Great place to start, fun & positive work place!!",Outbound ship dock,"I started in inbound stow and also was a water spider. I recently transferred to outbound ship dock and like this position best. You get to learn a variety of indirect roles such as a runner, water spider, robot operator and one of my personal favorites is operating the forklift. Management is very positive and friendly to workers from what I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen. They will stick up for you when needed and will help you advance in your job at Amazon if you choose to. I see negative reviews but I encourage anyone to give them a chance and really decide if this is you because these jobs are not for everybody. "
Amazon,1fh9d70lru1hk800,3,Truck trailers,Warehouse Associate,They typically would have a lot of lazy people. So if you are hard worker good luck at moving up. You might get lucky and talk to the right people and get a chance at a better position. The abundance of people make it almost impossible for a better position.  
Amazon,1fh94oknnt49t800,4,"Good pay, good co-workers ",Warehouse Employee ,"Compared to other warehouse locations, the compensation here is better. Benefits are good as well. Co-workers are usually friendly and helpful.  Management is usually someone that was previously in the entry level which I believe is a plus. The long hours and workload can be very demanding at times. "
Amazon,1fh94ob0it49t802,3,Hard work. Very short breaks,Picker/Packer,Its a fast place to find a job as many people quit because the work load is so heavy and the breaks are so short. It is easy to move up in the companyn if you work hard. I come into contact with many co-workers that have been passed up promotions because there is favortism.
Amazon,1fh91160vs9uh801,3,The most stressful and dehumanized job I've ever worked,Warehouse Associate,"I would say this is not a good job, however it a stable job that will hire almost anyone and will keep you as long as you want to stay, and for that it is a fantastic option for many, but the turnover rate is very high as everyone is looking to jump ship as soon as they can."
Amazon,1fh90s673n518802,1,Its alright,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"Working for amazon is honestly a hit or miss and depends on what you think qualifies for a good job. If you\'re only doing it for benefits and pay then its great! Other than that its trash. Its the HR on site and higher ups offsite that make it a terrible place to work at. I have had multiple incidents where it required me to miss work and I did not have enough PTO or UPT to cover it. They do not care about you or your excuses. I was told they dont accept doctors notes as an excuse to miss work. I had gotten covid after working there for two weeks, and after showing them a positive test result I was told from my ""case worker"" that I was not going to get the covid pay because it was suspected I had forged the test result. After showing them they were wrong they never contacted me back or gave me my back pay. On top of that the first week being back from covid I pulled a muscle in my foot on the job and after going through a lengthy process and keeping me out of work for the majority of the month of may while they knew I could work with accommodations they decided I could come back to work the last week of my recovery. I was told I was ineligible to get workers comp pay for the time missed because I was such a new worker and hadn\'t worked their long enough. This company is complete garbage.  "
Amazon,1fh8uh63ot66d801,1,High Stress,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"The long hours of work 10 - 12 hours a day plus overtime. Standing 90% of work day. Light to heavy lifting 10-12 hours a day. Stressful environment and working conditions. Unprofessional management staff. Employees are responsible for handling their own Human Resources. Amazon does not promote off of hardworking, dedication, skills & dependability, they work off of favoritism. Amazon can afford to pay employees more than it does. They seem to not hire from within like they state that they do.They should also offer 8 hour shifts. Job applicants should be aware that there are possibilities of backaches, headaches, swollen hands, arms, legs & feet, arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, stress, vision issues, high blood pressure and planters fasciitis, just to name a few."
Amazon,1fh8srbu6n518802,2,Just a job,Picker/Packer,"I worked for Amazon nearly 7 years (until 2010). It was good experience for a foreigner. I made good friends, good money but I was fired for misconduct...  I understand. I messed up. After 10 years (2021) I decided to apply for a part time job at Amazon to make extra money, but they still have my record and wont give a chance. They wont forgive and give a second chance even after 10 years?! Really?!"
Amazon,1fh8o2g73u1hk800,3,Overworking,Picker/Packer,Not enough breaks for a 10 hour shift they won\xe2\x80\x99t let you have a break till everyone is finished with their work. They over work you with loads of work. 
Amazon,1fh8matemt49t802,2,"Not so bad if you know what you're getting into, I imagine.",Warehouse Associate,Very hard manual labor at times.  When I worked it was post Christmas time and it was non stop.  The choice positions throughout my shift were normally sucked up by those who came in right before me as we had staggered shifts. 
Amazon,1fh8gt2klt49t803,4,A job to have while getting another job,Stocker,Is a good job to make money while pursuing other avenues. The work isn't incredibly difficult and it's enough to pay the bills if you single. If you need to support a family probably not the job for you.

Amazon,1fh88vmirt49t800,2,Overall easiest job but the work can be exhausting.,Picker,Very easy to get fired as well.

Amazon,1fh7mo0i1u1hk802,2,Good for some. You can feel left out here,Area Manager,I agree with this.  Everyone is new to the workforce and inexperienced. Not much opportunity to advance regardless of your experience. It\xe2\x80\x99s very much based on how you\xe2\x80\x99re manager feels about you. The pay is low and the hours are hard if you\xe2\x80\x99re on night shift. It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to get moved to days.
Amazon,1fh76bn89n518801,4,Mind Numbing ,Stower,"Taxes took half the check every week especially OT. The tasks tend to be mind numbing and monotonous. Prime Day/Week you belong to Amazon. So, don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to have a life outside of Amazon. Mandatory OT YOU BELONG TO AMAZON!!"

Amazon,1fh6o20vuu1hk802,2,Hard Working,Team Member,"Hard working, short breaks, You have to be self motivated. NO ONE will hold your hand and tell you that you're doing a great job. If you need constant affirmations from management, this company isn't for you."

Amazon,1fh6e3j64t49t801,3,"Easy Job, Poor Management",Picker,The management overcomplicates a relatively simple job by constantly wanting to exercise their authority over you.

Amazon,1fh60r4sot499802,3,Productive and flexible but not a place to be/stay,Fresh Associate,"Great flexibility and pay for what it is. Hard to succeed especially while trying to work around other people. Management is held to a certain standard and they often reflect that onto their employees\xe2\x80\x94which brings me to turnover. Until your location rehires too many new employees, then there is not enough time to go around for everyone!"

Amazon,1fh5lbc5sn518802,3,Its just what you'd expect ,Warehouse Associate,The work is just what you'd expect and improving your rate is constantly being pushed. Overall though working here sucks but its work if you need money this is the place.
Amazon,1fh5d56qfo2if802,4,Easy Sorting,Package Handler,"A typical day started with the managers telling us how many packages we were expecting, stretching, either sorted or scanned packages onto pallets for two hours. Then had a 30 minute break, came back for another two hours. Sometimes had to flex up "
Amazon,1fh53du8vs9uh802,2,A lot of work with little pay,Warehouse Worker,They should appreciate their workers more. They show favoritism. A lot of work with little pay. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend anybody to come work for this company. The flexibility is awesome.
Amazon,1fh52qemnn518801,4,Good place. Stresses you about rate,Picking,"Amazon talks a good talk about how they look out for us employees, but we're really only a number to them. Rate.

It better be two!Number of minutes it's taking you to go to the bathroom. Better not be many. "
Amazon,1fh4p5nr4u1hk802,2,Stowing and breaking my body while doing it.,Stower,"You need to work hard and fast. You cannot make mistakes. That is incredibly hard to do when you get tired from stowing the heavy boxes and walking 10 miles a day. Short breaks. Mandatory overtime (without being paid time and a half). If you miss more than one day, you are automatically fired (if you don\'t have the PTO to cover it). Very short breaks sitting outside on the hard concrete because the break area is ""still being built"". Very clique-y type environment. Incredibly long hours. Expensive cafeteria. Not that great of pay for the work that you have to do. So not worth it."

Amazon,1fh4j4tudu1hk802,1,Pay was decent,Fulfillment Associate,Job was stressful! They didn\xe2\x80\x99t take this pandemic seriously. There were employees who knew they had COVID-19 and still came to work and management knew it!
Amazon,1fh4amsvrnpdo801,3,Productive place. ,Warehouse Associate,"Over worked. Training does not meet my expectations. They train to do one thing. But the managers\xe2\x80\x99 way of doing things are totally different. They throw boxes and packages, not caring if they are fragile or not. There expect you to be perfectly ready to perform the duties with minimum on the job training. Breaks are given sparingly. "
Amazon,1fh479fcmt499800,1,A Soul Crushing furnace of human sacrifice,"Picker, Packer, Stower","Although the pay and benefits are above average, the culture is destructive. The attitude of most managers is dismissive and ignorant of the reality of the employees, the TOT is very short and there are harsh consequences for taking time consuming tasks such as fixing a computer error or using the bathroom, keep detailed scheduled notes for all activities. Finally for all the harsh disgusting environment, poor management support structures, safety issues and frankly unfair break structure, the worst thing of all is the absolute fear management has for hard working and ambitious employees, you don\xe2\x80\x99t move up without being given the worst duties."

Even if no one else is around you. People snitch on others. The managers are condescending and downright disrespectful. The conditions are loud, cold, hot, and very depressing.

Amazon,1fh1ujddnu2l5800,3,Benefits and Pay.,Warehouse Associate,"I took a shot with a warehouse position at Amazon. I started right before holiday season which requires 55 hour weeks. Trial by fire. I can guarantee that if you are new to this type of work environment the first month will be difficult. Beyond that, after you get past the learning curve it's not a bad job. It can strain your personal life because positions like this call for long hours. The pay and benefits are good. I have a medical condition that is controlled through expensive medication. Their standard health plan covers full cost. I honestly thought I would never be able to afford working a job above minimum wage without losing money. They will hire anybody. Seriously anybody. Our work culture is very diverse. The work gets very old and monotonous. It's not built to be long term unless you truly want to stay there. But it's a great opportunity if you need better pay or a bridge job. "
Amazon,1fh1t2on4s9uh801,4,What can I say? It’s amazon.,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"I worked here for a couple months and the job is pretty much repetitive. You have a set schedule every week so you can work around those hours. They give you 100 dollars in credits to spend on Amazon when you first start, they have 401k, insurance, and all that other good stuff. You work 10-12 hours but the pay sort of evens it out. Get premium if you work overnight. You don\xe2\x80\x99t really talk to many people working in certain stations and there aren\xe2\x80\x99t a lot of supervisors to talk to directly. Some things you have to figure out for yourself but I feel like this is somewhat a decent job."

Sometimes when you work harder, they come to thank you. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to talk to anyone if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to for most of the positions.

They move people up just based on who they know and not their work ethic. Management neve fixes any problems/concerns you bring to them. They praise the laziest of workers. If you're a hard worker and take pride in what you do, then you'll be the one who gets thrown under the bus and have to pick up others slack. HR are some of the rudest people to have to talk to. If you get hurt while working and have doctors orders for certain work limits, HR does NOT fully abide by them. The Workers Comp doctor they will send you to, is a quack.

Management will work you to the bone and you can't sit down! I was a packer which is one of the easier jobs at the warehouse, but it's still a lot of standing and walking from one place to another. Shifts are 10 hours longs with two 30 minute breaks throughout the day. They try not to have any workers just standing waiting for an order so if they don't see you working they will assume you're either slacking off or you don't have any work which then they'll move you to a different place. Getting in touch with HR is the worst! There are 3 different HR's 1.) the physical one in the warehouse. 2.) the outsourced HR in India who have no idea how to handle a situation through no fault of their own, they're given a basic manuscript and if your problem doesn't fit the criteria they can't really help you. 3.) the one that emails you if you go through the app. I would highly recommend staying away from this job, they will overwork you. Not to mention you don't always know when they'll spring overtime on you!"

My job was basically grabbing staged containers filled with packages and walking them across the other side of the warehouse, then loading them into trucks or staging nearby. Other roles including loading trucks with packages from conveyor belts. It is HOT in the warehouse, especially when loading inside the trucks. There are fans that point into the truck, but they provide little comfort. There are areas that have water, but some areas without. Expect to walk, even just to get to a water station.There were times were I was the only person tasked to walk staged containers as we were often short-staffed. It's extremely exhausting walking back and forth hauling carts and being the only person to do so. Since we were so short staffed, there would also be times where I was in charge of loading 4-5 trailers of packages from the conveyor belts all alone. In the 4 months of working for Amazon, I've seen plenty of people come and go, with few actually sticking around (those staying usually higher-role people).Staff are mostly friendly and in general great to hang around with when given the time to. All of the process assistants were extremely friendly and great at communicating with associates. Operation managers are a different story when it comes to communication. For example, I was tasked to remove carts from a trailer and leave them where other carts were staged. After unloading the entire trailer full of carts, I was then told by another manager that those carts were supposed to be loaded, not unloaded. There are plenty of other"

Amazon,1fgqr9qi3sa5l801,3,Warehouse Work,Fulfillment Associate,"As a picker, a typical day would be clocking in, going to the stand-up to find out what station I'm picking at and going to work. I worked the reduced -time shift so it was a long 12 hours. Considering I have to make a 40 minute commute, I'm always exhausted and the job just isn't sustainable. It's a very physically demanding job and I would not suggest doing it long-term unless you just want to work slow. Working slow means audits and potential right ups. They also micro-manage your time (time-off-task) by when you logged into the station and working. Every second is logged and we only had a 6 minute grace period to use the bathroom if we needed to. Being a warehouse, nothing is a close walk. Don't plan on making a ton of friends unless you're just friendly because there's no way to just talk to people while working.  They do give some leeway in my warehouse, but slacking too much isn't good. Keeping up with their standard honestly won't work in the long-run. If you work hard, good managers will usually recognize that and you could get moved up and trained in other areas though. My manager is great, but I usually never see him because they walk all over the warehouse."

I preferred splitting packages between lanes because I would not have to worry about making nicely built pallets, especially when certain areas would have packages that just do not mesh together well. However, I have heard that people find splitting boring because on a slow day, time does seem to go by extremely slow. I personally loved my amazon location. My operation managers and processing assistants were all nice to me and I loved how flexible my schedule was. I did note that some people complained about not having enough hours, but I personally did not have that issue as I only planned to work for the summer.

Asking for days off or literally anything to do with the job itself, they are pretty much useless. There is always a lack of communication between HR so if they tell you that it's fine to take a day off and that they would approve it, they wont.

Amazon,1fgn7nr1go1dp800,2,Sortation Associate - Unsatisfying despite the pay and benefits,Amazon Sortation Associate,"   Although Amazon provides great benefits and above-average pay relative to similar companies, the work is unfulfilling, exhausting and extremely repetitive.    Safety is only a concern once an incident actually occurs and there is no enforcement on employees maintaining covid-19 protocols.    Productivity rates and the bottom line are top priority over safety and employee satisfaction / well-being. As a sortation associate, you are expendable and are not incentivized to do well.   The work culture is heavily clique involved and respect among others can be hard to come by if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t a part of the group, especially with management.   This job is great as a bridge between other opportunities; Amazon can help you fill in the gaps with pay and employment benefits, but the novelty of working here quickly erodes into a \xe2\x80\x9cdo what you need to do to get by\xe2\x80\x9d sentiment.    Take it for what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth; Amazon is by no means a dream job filled with opportunities, but you can certainly count on the pay and benefits. It\xe2\x80\x99s how they hold onto a select few despite the high turnover rate. You will see new faces every month if you stay long enough to see it. "
Amazon,1fgn34iuos9sg801,5,You need to switch locations to advance from Tier One,Shipping and Receiving Clerk,The worst is when non-Amazon Managers come onboard because they are clueless as to priorities and how Amazon works.

I worked night shifts and it was honestly the worst experience ever, I felt like a zombie all day long from doing those extensive labor tasks all night long. There's basically no work-life balance in question. Breaks are terribly short in comparison with the work that they have you perform. You're always expected to work on par with their desired rate. The money is decent though, especially if you work overtime so that's one good thing about working there. It's a mind-numbing job that makes you feel like a brainless zombie and devours your sense of reality (I'm not even kidding). No wonder Amazon has one of the highest turnover rates."

The pay is some of the best out there for minimum skills and they train you on everything they have you do. I currently work for a delivery center which is ALOT of physical work, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not hard either. YOU WILL LOSE ALOT OF WEIGHT so you can end that gym membership, Amazon has you covered lol. The benefits are some of the best out there and are very accommodating to women. You get up to 10 weeks of maternity leave along with 10 weeks you can use at anytime during the child\xe2\x80\x99s first year of life. They have a breast pump room(called the mothers room) and provide free feminine products in the bathrooms. Their benefits offer fertility coverage and you can also get stock in the company as a retirement plan. There will be bad days but that\xe2\x80\x99s with ANY job.

Amazon,1fgmanvf4309p002,1,No,Amazon Warehouse Associate,Good pay but not good for ya mental health. All the see you as is a number and then always get upset when you use ya pto and hours you earn. Benefits are jice
Amazon,1fgm45fvsn5cv802,4,Great place to work,Warehouse Associate,I was very skeptical about this job until I applied and it\xe2\x80\x99s a very simple job. Great benefits and you get opportunities to do other positions to your liking. 
Amazon,1fglssuudo1dp801,4,Simple enough job with flexible schedules. ,Central Operations Associate,"I was a Central Operations Associate who dispatched for food deliveries, and I stayed for 2 years. It\xe2\x80\x99s a simple enough job at $15 an hour but we were always capped at 25 hours a week if even that. It\xe2\x80\x99s a first coke first served when it comes to shifts so that can be frustrating and worrying at times when you\xe2\x80\x99re unable to work as much. As a desk job that\xe2\x80\x99s never exciting, but everyone there was relatively welcoming and nice. It can just be really boring at times and makes you feel a lack of purpose. You can feel easily replaceable. "

Amazon,1fglmkdfls7ho802,3,Ehhh it’s alright,Package Handler,Fulfillment centers are good job starters and a place to get back on your feet. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend working there for a long time unless you\xe2\x80\x99re starting a career with amazon or your getting tuition assistance.

Amazon,1fgll26jn309p000,2,It’s a job,Order Picker,"Pays bills, not much else to say. It\xe2\x80\x99s all numbers, you\xe2\x80\x99re a number to them realistically. It\xe2\x80\x99s very straightforward in what\xe2\x80\x99s needed from you, it can be a mentally challenging place to work. "

Able to be helpful, manage and critique people for the better of the company."
Amazon,1fglfv6j1n5d5800,4,Great people but overworked,Warehouse Associate,"It's a great place to work if you can work hard, I've made a couple of great friends and the pay and benefits are amazing. However it's very hard to get time off, and I've had a very difficult time with disability at work. My team is very nice but corporate has been a pain. You are expected to put work before everything else, you do not get days off. "
Amazon,1fglfmk4un5cv800,4,Very productive and decent work environment,Package Handler,"Work is always available. Majority of the employees are great to work with. Mandatory overtime is inconvenient and there is no room for flexibility. If your a person like me who values the quality of family time and life the mandatory overtime work schedule may get in the way of that. Management is very helpful, supportive, friendly but communication needs a little work. However, many of us can use a crash course is communication. Overall, very thankful to be employed here for the time being \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a"
Amazon,1fgle0enoo1dp802,4,Very repetitive and physically demanding ,Delivery Driver,Driving for amazon was very fun when I first started but grew to be very repetitive and physically demanding (if you work with urgency) great job if you have no family and very few bills

It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t bad, once you find your place and your friends you will enjoy it more and more. Sometimes the pay is exactly what you need or it not enough, it where your head is at."
Amazon,1fgl1rvu4n59l802,5,Fast paced ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Faced paced.       Worth it for the check.     Mandatory overtime is killer.    Sign on bonuses.                                     Definitely get some good shoes. 
Amazon,1fgl1cvksn59l802,2,Decent temporary job,Shipping Clerk,I was at Amazon for 2 years and held several tier 1 positions as well as 2 PA positions.  The work is extremely fast paced and stressful.  Would not recommend you stay in a warehouse for more than a few months. 
Amazon,1fgkujat1n59l800,4,Not a Bad Job at All,Warehouse Associate,"For whatever reasons, Amazon gets a lot of flack, but I worked here for three years and it was one of the easiest jobs I have enjoyed. Providing you are equipped with several solid pairs of sneakers, comfortable clothes, stay hydrated, and get some good sleep - it's simple. Go to work, work quickly, go home and forget about work. My only complaint was the short (30 minutes) lunch break, but I have heard from current employees that the lunch break is longer now."
Amazon,1fgksr5oo309p002,2,It's Amazon,Transportation associate,Work and thats all they care about.  Don't do the job and you will be fired.  They really could care less about you and your life.  It's all about making them money.  Most managers are new to Amazon and have no real clue how to manage or do the job.
Amazon,1fgkqsjuln5cv802,1,Excellent job to work here,Paramedic,"The benefits and pay are great. You don\'t feel pressured or suffocated with management hanging over you. Few of my friends couldn\'t pass the interview they have what you call ""stage fright"" But they are dag on good workers."

Amazon,1fgkh4sp1o1e9800,1,It’s a horrible place to work at,Prep Receiver ,They don\xe2\x80\x99t care about their employees. They only care for money and to make \xe2\x80\x9cnumbers\xe2\x80\x9d. No one ever follows any Safety rules. Management don\xe2\x80\x99t care about their employees and HR doesn\xe2\x80\x99t ever help you when you need help. They only have excuses on why they can\xe2\x80\x99t help you.
Amazon,1fgkfd49psa5l800,3,"Easy, fast paced job.",IC/QA Support,"Easy, fast paced job. Meet hourly quota or get written up depending on your job for the day. My job was so stress free and peaceful to the point that others thought I did nothing, but for some reason I was really unhappy. The work environment made me feel depressed so I ended up leaving. Pay was below average for the work they expected everyone to do."
Amazon,1fgkdrod7n5cv802,2,"10 hour days, mandatory overtime during peak, High rates per hour.",Customer/vendor returns,"From picking/ stowing, anything at Amazon had a rate per hour. If you didn't meet the rate you would get coaching and eventually write ups. You got cross trained in every department so they could put you where they needed help. During peak 60 hour mandatory overtime was dreadful. "
Amazon,1fgkag8b3sa5l802,2,Na,Manager,Horrible Managers at ATL12 building.  Always Chess never Checkers.  Extremely political and will fire you in a heart beat. But over the company as a whole is great 
Amazon,1fgka6nq0s7ho800,4,Good workplace but terrible work/life balance,Picker/Packer,"Loved the people I had the opportunity to work with, supervisors were always friendly and helpful but I was away from home for 12+ hours a day with having to work 10 hour shifts plus the 2 hours spent driving to/from work and always exhausted . Job itself was easy enough but very physical ."
Amazon,1fgk8cn6gn5d5800,5,Good,FC Associate I,"Full time work, fast paced work environment. Never stuck with the same work/job daily. Hardest part of the job is being on feet all shift long. I have learned several different processes within the warehouse. Have also been trained to drive different forklifts."
Amazon,1fgk7jfbp309p001,2,Amazon sucks,Warehouse Worker,"didn't get much of any training, kind of just thrown into it. Very unorganized and stressful at times. Management sucks but sometimes coworkers are nice which kind of makes up for it."
Amazon,1fgk3d80ds7ho800,3,"A fast-paced and physically straining workplace, but can't complain too much",Package Handler,"This job is fast-paced and physically demanding. The way I set up my schedule, allowed me to work only on the weekends so I could focus on school, which was a plus."
Amazon,1fgjkedmtn5d5800,5,Productive ,Package Handler,It was good and nice pay me benefit. A lot of flexibility in your schedule with a home life balance. Work for your position. Do the work and perform at your best to succeed 
Amazon,1fgjfumkb309p001,1,they treat workers like garbage,Warehouse Worker,"supervisors think they are better than everyone, bossing people around to meet quotas.Amazon offers good benifites but they treat empolyees like garbage."
Amazon,1fgjdknmcn5d5802,2,Not the best,Warehouse Associate/Returns Processor,Amazon isn\xe2\x80\x99t the best place to work despite good pay and benefits. It is really hard labor and the management is unreliable. I would not recommend working here unless you wanted to be treated like a child
Amazon,1fgjaijjhn5d5802,4,Productive and fast paced ,Team Member,Amazon jobs help me out when I needed extra money especially doing the pandemic. I was happy to work hours and even extra hours when available. It was the best part time for because the money was great. HRC needs serious work. Mistakes can be made that can cause you not to be rehired and there\xe2\x80\x99s no way to speak with anyone in HR to correct the mistake. So SOL. 
Amazon,1fgiqd0c2pi92802,3,"Great until we had to pull 5,000 lb pallets with a mask on",Warehouse Associate,"Great until we had to pull 5,000 lb pallets with a mask on what can i say its great place to make a consistent rate if you your looking for something else "
Amazon,1fgiomutiu412802,4,"Overall good place to work, but stressful",Amazon Alexa Flex,"The Flex position allowed you to choose your own hours out of a set block they offer. The only problem with that, is sometimes only the worst hours are available. Or there are scattered times where you will work 30 minutes, be off for 30 minutes, work an hour, etc. (I worked remotely though so this is okay)Hardest part was dealing with angry customers and meeting metrics (it was usually easy to meet metrics but one disgruntled customer and your metrics can be completely skewed)Most enjoyable was working from home and having flexible hours.Management was usually nice and helpful."
Amazon,1fgilji8tu412801,3,Independent work ,Warehouse Team Member,Typically do not talk to anyone at work. Good for what it is. Picking shifts is cool and flexible but gets annoying when shifts aren\xe2\x80\x99t available. Very difficult to get in touch with HR or any management. 
Amazon,1fgij1subu412802,1,Dangerously fast paced,Amazon Delivery Driver,"This is not a long term job. Work here but constantly look for better. This job is for young people with no kids and nothing going on in life. You will deal with dogs, snakes, cats, rude customers and going up 3 flight of stairs constantly. "
Amazon,1fgibuhbg3kji001,3,Easy ,Prime Shopper,Very easy job. Make your own schedule and off needed any days off just do it through an app only bad thing was the really short breaks. Management could be better 
Amazon,1fgibu7olu412802,5,What is good are the benefits; what is bad is the salary and shift selections.,Fulfillment Associate,If we had the chance to choose our shifts with more anticipation we could plan better.   It\xe2\x80\x99s stressful to not be able to have the shifts for the week that some one needs.  It is so difficult. 
Amazon,1fgiadu97u412802,3,it was ight,Prime Now Associate,"not bad, not good, pay could be better tho, worked here for a year and some change, i did like the job but it got boring and wasn't worth only being pay enough."
Amazon,1fgi6si4ru428800,3,Great pay but not much sense of community or purpose,Picker,"The work is very easy to learn and do; it\'s almost impossible to hit their goal for you all the time, but as long as you just keep up a good work ethic you\'ll be fine. For how easy the job is, the pay is great, but I will say that working at Amazon is by far the most boring, dull ""thing"" I\'ve ever done in my life. You\'re constantly moving around, so you can\'t talk to anyone and you\'re doing the same exact thing for around 10 hours with a couple short breaks."
Amazon,1fgi6gbp4hie4802,3,Productive place to work ,Warehouse Associat. Pack Flow Outbound,To many new hires being brought on to have work VTO is put out when there are no stations available for you to work on. Once you run out of pto or upt you would be up for termination. The bright side to things you only work 4 days and have 3 off work is repetitive so if you can deal with doing the same thing for 10 hours then you'll do just fine in here.
Amazon,1fgi1j7u9o15m802,2,mentally draining job,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"it was mentally draining to drive to the facility everyday at the crack of dawn to sort boxes onto pallets. it got real repetitive, real quick. not to mention that everybody is in everybody's business, talk about big brother. the one saving grace, was the friends I was able to make and work with. they were the only reason I found it hard to leave. The breaks are designed to make sure you don't actually rest. The pay is really minimum wage. the wage is $15 but they only give you 4 hours to work unless you sign up for more hours which I doubt you'll do cuz they make sure you are TIRED after one shift."
Amazon,1fghrba54u412800,4,Workplace,Warehouse Associate,"Rating 5 out of 5 I enjoy working for Amazon, due to the amount of flexibility it offered. I currently work at Amazon Fresh and it is enjoyable. I am able to go to work without having to feel as though I won't have a great shift. From the moment I started working there, I have always had a great shift. Not only that but I have been able to connect with my coworkers and see how hard they work too, just like me."
Amazon,1fghqrk4ho15m802,3,Just a lot of manual labor,Associate,Can make good friends but very brutal in the body working long hard hours with little time in between the shifts. Make sure to get in soles for your shoes. 
Amazon,1fghojvrdo15m801,2,It’s who you know not what you know ,Fulfillment Associate,It\xe2\x80\x99s a ok place to work if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind doing the same thing everyday they stop on top of you to make rate it\xe2\x80\x99s a certain way to check packaging if you do it the right way your taking to long to process people that don\xe2\x80\x99t follow the rules of processing makes rate 
Amazon,1fghm455fhie4800,2,They don’t recognize hard work,Packer,"They overwork the people who seem the most willing to work, do not show them any respect or have a high rate or they will take advantage of that and put you in the same position everyday."
Amazon,1fghm25fk3kji000,3,Simple review,Picker/Packer,Amazon is a good company. If you luck out and get a location with machines then works pretty simple but Amazon will never pay you what you\xe2\x80\x99re worth. Other warehouses pay better. 
Amazon,1fghim8hqsa1l802,1,Not a place to work.,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"In my opinion this entire industry sucks. But, the pace that Amazon sets is inhuman, and physically debilitating. Your body will break down quickly, at the pace they expect you to work at Amazon."
Amazon,1fgh7t4jeu428800,5,Great job,Prime Shopper,Awesome pay with flexible scheduling. I was able to work my full time job and this job easily. Such a great experience working with great people. I loved working here
Amazon,1fggmsp5cs7mv802,4,Fast paced and easy but physical work,Learning Ambassador,Warehouse work is physical but rewarding work. There are many opportunities for advancement if you work hard and prove that you want to excel. 4 day work weeks are a plus if you choose that schedule. 
Amazon,1fggkj80ihie4800,5,Amazing & Excellent company,Customer Service Associate,"I love Amazon! They welcomed me with open arms & all of my co - workers are extremely helpful and do not have an attitude towards any team members. Everyone works together as a team, so you are never alone. Dealing with customers is not always easy; my Amazon team makes the job flow so easily and we all handle and treat all customers respectfully. Customer service is more than just dealing with customers - it is all about making sure they have an amazing encounter & interaction with you and ensuring that their concerns and worries are more than well taken care of...they need to see, feel, and know that they will be ""taken care of"" and their packages are or will be safe, secure, and ready for pickup or returns. I love how Amazon treats and takes care of all employees and customers. There is a unity and warmth in the atmosphere and work environment...and all energies are positive!! No negativity. It is all love, openess, and they wekcome u with open arms. Amazon is a beautiful company that continues to grow and I am happy I am apart of this company and culture \xf0\x9f\x92\x9c\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
Amazon,1fgggsqaqpi92801,3,An okay place to work at but definitely not to stay,Associate,"You clock in and basically become a number. The only way to advance is through showing good results and being favorited by managers. You generally work 4 days a week for 10 hours if you' re full time. During peak seasons, you could be working 11 hours on top of an extra day. It may not sound like much on paper but can take a toll on you whether it be physically or mentally. "
Amazon,1fgg9jv9g3kji000,4,Wages and people ,Package sorter,Cancel your gym membership because you will have plenty of exercise working at Amazon . Constant moving at a fast pace to achieve your daily goals . Good luck 
Amazon,1fgfu53qv3kji002,4,Productive workplace ,Fulfillment Associate,"This job is somewhat physically demanding but very simple and I liked the company overall.

Amazon,1fgftavpuu428801,2,Excellent Benefits ,"Stowe Associate, Ambassador, Quality",they won\xe2\x80\x99t ever let you sit down only on your breaks. There are Great benefits depend on what location you work for. If you can take the demands of standing this is for you. Metric driven company.
Amazon,1fgfpkf5ru412802,3,Good pay  if you work overtime. ,Warehouse Worker,"Pretty  average pay, easy job. If you want nice paychecks you need to work 60 hours a week.  Which is always  available.

Amazon,1fgfo9etl3kji002,3,"Good pay, sometimes stressful",Software Development Engineer I,"Good compensation although not as many extra benefits as other large tech companies. people are kind. Sometimes stressful, and management can be hit or miss depending on the team. "

Amazon,1fgeg3d1bhie4801,2,A human robot,Fulfillment Associate,Dont work here if you got back problems!! They dont accommodate you at all even if you bring doctors (note paper documentation) they dont care about your health 
Amazon,1fgedpjnvhie4802,5,The warehouse was a great place to work hands down,Amazon Warehouse Associate,Everything about Amazon was great. Exciting actually. Loved coming to work. I got sick. Had proper paperwork but took HR almost 3 months to solve the situation. So it damaged my income for that time. Then when finally got back took 2 weeks for me to use my badge and almost a month before I was actually on the schedule again. But so I had no choice but to find another source of income. But even still I loved Amazon and would go back no problem. Hope yhe review helped
Amazon,1fgec3q12u412802,4,Tiring ,Recieving Associate,"It was okay. Very tiring being that you are standing for long periods of time. Wish breaks were longer, but it\xe2\x80\x99s good pay just will be very exhausted."
Amazon,1fgdsegefo15m802,2,Picker,Picker,Mandatory overtime every week. The more people in the city the busier it would be. Managers are cool as long as you hit your numbers they won\xe2\x80\x99t ever bother you. As soon as you don\xe2\x80\x99t you\xe2\x80\x99ll be talked to. It can tiring working 5 days 
Amazon,1fgdjqnbppi92801,2,Only a good place to work if you like being paid a lot but treated poorly. ,Security Officer (Full-time),"Our department went through 6 managers in 8 months.  Not because they did anything wrong but they were moved into other positions with lack of focusing on our department.  There is a weird culture of favoritism, bureaucracy, and politics in the work place.  It was difficult to have a work connection with your manager in order for him to see your talents and progress.  You are definitely treated like a number and not a human being.  The ability to advance is challenged in a negative way and not motivated.  Also they take people not qualified to be in management and like to promote those not experienced because it is to cliche of what other companies do.  They feel they can get better ideas from those that have not worked years in a certain field.  Their interview process is ridiculous and intimidating.   They like people who can sweet talk them rather than hiring someone who knows the actual job.   I was only there for 8 months and I didn't even work in a warehouse/fulfillment center. I worked at an office building/call center.  I couldn't imagine how terrible it could be at a fulfillment center but have heard stories.  The pay is great compared to competitors but it comes at a cost.   "
Amazon,1fgd7p209o29h800,5,Considering working for Amazon? DO IT!!!,Human Resources Assistant,You will not be disappointed in all this company has to offer. Medical insurance Blue Cross PPO total of $30/month. Manager approval is not required to take off work(just make sure you have the hours to cover absence) Employees take a daily survey on their manager's performance. If he/she is not up to par they are put on corrective action.(I know this bc I've worked on amazon HR Teams). Pay is low compared to similar roles outside of the company HOWEVER Amazon has a Great culture and lots of opportunities to advance and these are only a few of the perks!!
Amazon,1fgd7gofio15m800,2,Trash place to work. Do not do full time ,Associate,"Trash company to work for. It has no limits to the drama and poor management. It\xe2\x80\x99s who you know and not what you are good at. A typical day at work is driving very early to the warehouse to pick up my cities parcels for the day. Making route across the city all day in sometimes hard to reach places and some tough terrain. Some of my clients are in very rural areas. Meanwhile, keeping track of my round of drivers and their progress throughout the day. Logging and keeping track of everything to the mile and minute of the day. It pays. This is timed work. Upper management could be more accommodating when it comes to fuel expenses and reimbursement. The job does not pay that well when you paying for all the fuel. Hardest part of the job would be the homes with no lights, no house numbers and you need to get through farmland to get to the door. I enjoyed the daily driving, my teammates, and meeting people, talking to them and getting to know the city really well."

If you have strong morals and believe you should be rewarded for hard work instead of sucking up you might want to look somewhere else. It\xe2\x80\x99s not all bad but the bad definitely out weighs the good. 
Amazon,1fgcrfcr1u428800,4,its a job,FC shipping,amazon has its good and it's bad. Just work and go home. No need to try and make friends. The work can be demanding but if you're a good worker you'll do fine
Amazon,1fgccs27hs7mv801,3,Fun workplace ,Virtual Customer Service Representative,People are great however you will be overworked and not provided with update or accurate resources. Also you have to wait for any sign on bonuses and benefits.
Amazon,1fgccol9bpi92802,3,"10 hour work days, little interaction with others. ",Warehouse Associate,Amazon is an OK place to work.  You get over worked for the pay. There is very little interaction with others. Managers usually come around once a week and talk to you for 2 to 5 minutes. 
Amazon,1fgc70tgku412802,4,Fast paced/Easy Money,Picker,"Fast paced, trained for a few days and started on the Hi-lo on my third day, I got a Christmas bonus unexpectedly, I was very appreciative of that considering it was Christmas time.

Amazon,1fgc458i8hie4800,2,Definitely Peculiar,Management ,"I\'ve never worked somewhere that was such a contradiction. Amazon is indeed peculiar as they like to boast. As long as you don\'t wear anything offensive and isn\'t a potential safety concern, almost anything goes. I\'ve seen fellow ""Amazonians"" wear pajama bottoms to work but the going thing seems to be sweat pants. Probably a good idea since alot of the positions are rate driven and the managers will let you know if you\'re not making it. There is no physical screening for physical dexterity or strength and it\'s not infuriating for some to not last a week due to the physical demands. Right off the bat, you\'re given unpaid time off (UPT) that\'s renewed 4 times a year with 20 hrs.  Might need it too since there is little to no actually training with most of it done by video or power point. No classroon-type environment. Ironic since alot of it IS planned out by day and week. If you\'re good at picking up on things, might be worth a try. But there\'s a LOT of repetition in the management role as far as reporting incidents goes and little to no HR support after 0230. "
Amazon,1fgc3lao1sa1l802,5,Contract postion,Recruiting Coordinator,I worked there on a 3 month contract and it was a great position. Manager was amazing and the job itself was great. The pay could have been a little better but still not bad considering the work life balance.

Lied about \xe2\x80\x9c$17.80 hourly\xe2\x80\x9d for overnights, said it was Management mistake it\xe2\x80\x99s only $16.80. Managers have favorites. 20 min breaks. 30 min lunch. Constantly moving around. Lots of 30-50lb lifting and if you can\xe2\x80\x99t lift it by yourself it\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to find somebody to help out. Mandatory last min work days. "

Anyone driven to suceed will greatly prosper while working here.  Helpfull managers and great HR."
Amazon,1fgaihaatsa1l802,5,Productive and fun workplace,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,I used to work full time but since I had to start school I had to do the Flex shift positions which allowed me to still be employed as long as I maintain 20 hours per month. I usually end up doing more than 20 hours per month anyway but I like knowing that any time I don\xe2\x80\x99t have classes I can show up to work as long as there are shifts for that day. 
Amazon,1fgaevlkhpi92800,2,Not an okay job,Amazon Warehouse Associate,This is probably the worst place you can work at they do not care about their employees at all. If you want to have a life then this isn't the place to work.
Amazon,1fgae9kiau428800,3,If you have family stay away,Warehouse Worker,They work you like crazy. They don\xe2\x80\x99t care if anything happens to you. Because after all to them you\xe2\x80\x99re just a number and you\xe2\x80\x99re easily replaceable. Most people I worked with stuck to themselves. 
Amazon,1fgadonivs7mv800,3,Okay place to work,FC Associate I,Work gets overwhelming. Different schedules. Great pay with bonus. Hr is not helpful at all. You only get 48 hours of personal time each year. No room for promotion. 
Amazon,1fgaab2i1sa1l802,3,Completely Ridiculous,Customer Support Specialist,"Management isn't around most of the time so employees frequently do nothing and still collect a check leaving the one's who actually do the job to feel EXTREMELY over-burdened. It wouldn't be as big of a problem if they cracked down these employees more efficiently, but these people can go weeks at a time before management addresses their poor performance. Then they bring in new people and the cycle repeats. Oh and good luck getting enough hours when they post 20 shifts at a time and 30+ people are racing to get a shift."
Amazon,1fga8blknhie4801,3,Constantly pushed to go faster,Picker,The job itself was easy but it was very repetitive and eventually wore down my body. Management got some sort of bonus for our production so they always pushed us to move faster.
Amazon,1fga65vr2o29h800,4,Mostly amazing,HR Business Partner,"Love everything but the pay as an internal of 5+ years, Not fun to see externals with less exp. come in with higher pay simply because you want to attract them, Internals leave left and right because of this divide, Very rare to find tenured leaders.

Amazon,1fga1a70js7mv800,2,Underpaid ,Associate,It COULD be a great place to work if the pay matched the work you do. It\xe2\x80\x99s even more frustrating because you know in being so cheap they have become so rich off of your hard work and sweat. If you have a future there it\xe2\x80\x99s being miserable in management. Good luck

Amazon,1fg9gcjunsa1l802,5,The opportunity that it offers // The bad is the new time system ,Warehouse Associate,No comment I like the company good or bad.  Many companies have strong strength and room to improve but for the most part Amazon is a great experience for me and in different circumstances I could have had a wonderful experience 
Amazon,1fg9f933nsa1l802,3,Meh,Packer/Shipper,It's a warehouse. Good pay. Insurance as soon as you're hired. Good management. Hard work. Stand on your feet a lot. Hard to keep up with the production rates. Only stayed 3 months before I moved to another state.

Amazon,1fg9bfbvfu428802,4,Great Place to Work Overall,Fulfillment Associate,The work you\xe2\x80\x99re doing is fairly easy for what you get paid. You\xe2\x80\x99re not breaking a sweat but at some point you\xe2\x80\x99ll be placed on the line as a line loader you will be standing in one spot all day. 
Amazon,1fg961o7iu412801,2,It’s ok for young people,Area Manager,Not much to get excited about. Everyone is new to the workforce and inexperienced. Not much opportunity to advance regardless of your experience. It\xe2\x80\x99s very much based on how you\xe2\x80\x99re manager feels about you.  The pay is low and the hours are hard if you\xe2\x80\x99re on night shift. It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to get moved to days. 
Amazon,1fg92gsdmhie4801,3,The Job is okay..,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,if you like working 4 days out the week and so many more on holidays then Amazon is for you. The pay is good HR is terrible. but you could get through it with the three days off but at times it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even feel like you\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten 3 days off.
Amazon,1fg8q1ukepi92802,4,Easy ,Fulfillment Associate,"Good place to works, nowhere near as bad as most people say. Peak season can be kinda hectic but as long as you stay focused the work is no problem at all "

Amazon,1fg8nd23lu412802,5,Easy money,FC Associate,"Super easy job for most positions, picking, single pack, and stow are super simple and easy (those are the ones I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trained to do) if you like being by yourself this is the perfect job, but if you like interacting with people maybe consider something else because it can get boring and repetitive because you stay in one spot for majority of your shift putting items in boxes.  Good pay for an entry level job"
Amazon,1fg8j6i3ku428802,5,Great place to work,Industrial Maintenance Technician,This place is a great place to work they have a lot of opportunities for you schooling teaching. They will help you with whatever you want. They will send you anywhere for training
Amazon,1fg8bq5n6sa1l802,5,Productive ,Amazon Warehouse Associate,I really like the job. It\xe2\x80\x99s really easy it\xe2\x80\x99s just the sleeping schedule that messes with me. I plan on staying for a while. Good benefits. If anything I\xe2\x80\x99d relocate since I live an hour away. 
Amazon,1fg86qt3t3kji000,4,Decent Job,Warehouse Worker,"Decent work for decent pay , they also provide pretty good benefits if you're a full time employee , the intensity can be fun but also stressful as an Amazon Warehouse Team Member"
Amazon,1fg7trsephie4800,2,Amazon doesn’t care about employees,Area Manager,"If you have any questions ask me. It might not be all sites but they definitely don\xe2\x80\x99t care about employees physical or mental health. The job description is false, the money isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth it because you will be working overtime a lot and your associates will be making more than you, especially if they are getting paid double time."
Amazon,1fg7p6eu4u428802,5,Productivity ,wharehouse worker,The pay is nice but the management  is bad some of my friends had to treat management of management  because  they don't know how to talk to people but all in all it's an OK company  alot of work
Amazon,1fg7jfasppi92802,3,Flexible but boring,Problem Solver,Job is very flexible with the time off options offered. Pay is decent. Managers and work culture is terrible. The benefits are quite good tho. Boring and repetitive tasks. 
Amazon,1fg7hq9b8hie4801,3,It’s a job. ,Warehouse Associate,The good is the benefits and if you like working out and lifting weights this job will be perfect for you. The bad is short break times and the raises. I worked there for 3 years and only got a 75 cent raise but overall it\xe2\x80\x99s a great warehouse job and very team oriented . 
Amazon,1fg7fegtgu428801,4,Easy Money,Amazon Associate,Good job if you just want to zone out and do the same task over and over till it's time to go. Coworkers are friendly but there is no opportunity for advancement.
Amazon,1fg7el57thie4801,4,It’s productive and fun ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,The hardest part of this job is the point system and scanning your card to clock in and out I was late maybe three times and that\xe2\x80\x99s why they fired me 
Amazon,1fg7bm5ughie4800,5,Good place to work for the money paid ,FC Associate I,Work is easy enough for what you are being paid. Management isn\xe2\x80\x99t always friendly to new staff so be prepared for that. If you need a job that encourages acceptance of individuality this is your place. 
Amazon,1fg79ar03u412802,4,Hard work great benefits ,Problem Solver,The pay is good but the labor is hard and long. You get all of your benefits the first day and they try to help you transition to stand on your feet all day long
Amazon,1fg76l0bnhie4801,3,"Fast-pace, and great Benefits. Slacking management ",Picker,"Amazon is a great place to work if you like money. But if you also value your Bones, Limbs, and mental health, then this place is not for you. The pay STARTS at 15.80 which is great. It is extremely hard to find a manager when you need help. The first month of working feels like h*ll on your body. You will be in excruciating pain for the first few weeks but eventually it will wear off. It is hard to get accommodations for any medical issue. Anyone that\xe2\x80\x99s not tier 1 tends not to care about you, let alone talk to you. Break is not long enough, only 30 minutes, when it takes a solid 10 minutes to even get from your station to the front door of the building. There are favorites here of course, and even if you\xe2\x80\x99re working your butt off you may or may not become a favorite due to how upper associates choosing their favorites and who moves up based on popularity, Flrting, and only sometimes work ethic."
Amazon,1fg6sc43phie4802,1,It’s easy till others don’t do their job,Sortation Associate,"Let me make this short, I was excited to make the bag working here. Turns out the job is relatively easy but here\xe2\x80\x99s the issue, other coworkers just stand around and talk, they don\xe2\x80\x99t at least multi task. They literally make eye contact w eachother and don\xe2\x80\x99t work or scan anything. Some people also don\xe2\x80\x99t scan anything but they give you more boxes or jiffies to scan. They solely move things from the belt to you. If you are one minute late to your shift over the 5 min grace period they take a whole hour from the shift you worked. There is ALOT of favoritism, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure with the amount of people talking to eachother instead of working they would be on TOT (time off task- basically they can see how many times you have scanned, they can write you up for being at 0, usually a manager or PA will look for you and tell you to go scan something cause you are on TOT). instead the MANAGERS or PA or LINE LEADS will join their conversation instead of telling them to get to work. Also what I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is they scan the lazy people\xe2\x80\x99s badge if they know them and I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming excuse them from scanning so they WONT be on TOT. And then proceed to continue talking instead of working. I am so SICK of this favoritism, another thing if they see you working hard and getting things done they will pick on you to go help clear another lane or go stage or go do extra work. That includes sending you to a lane that has a bunch of lazy people and the lane is backed up so YOU are chosen to pick up the slack since they see you working hard. They only care about productivity. I\xe2\x80\x99ve met only one PA that actually cares"
Amazon,1fg6ojcsis7mv800,2,Its a good first job,Heavy Machine Operator,"Other warehouse companies love to hire Amazon dropouts. Pay is good, work and management leave much to be desired. Do it for christmas, and then run away."
Amazon,1fg6h91scu412802,3,Only pay & benefits ,Package Handler,"If you have no social  life this is the job for you! The benefits & pay will always be a plus whether you\xe2\x80\x99re remote or in a warehouse. The job is draining, exhausting etc etc . They only care about HR & above. "
Amazon,1fg6aet7gu428801,5,Loved it ,Problem Solver,This was one of them jobs you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind waking up for and getting dressed without being mad. Yes the hours were long but you know what you signed up for. They make sure you have a good time all while getting the job done!!
Amazon,1fg64o93io15m800,4,So far so good but not sure about the future,Software Developer,"Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s job is kinda scary because I have always heard the PIP culture of Amazon, and also the on-call is painful to deal with. But from my half of year experience in Amazon so far it is much better than I expected, but the overall working culture is kinda toxic."
Amazon,1fg61jnt9hie4801,1,Will Quickly Kill Your Soul,Packaging Associate,"You\'re just a number to these people. Managers don\'t care, they\'re just trying to meet their numbers goals, and if you\'re not dying to help them do that, then you\'re useless and expendable. I\'ve worked at several Amazon facilities (DS, FC) since 2016, in three different states and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that the atmosphere, culture, management favoritism and overall BS is the same no matter where you go. The reviews you see that say ""Some people just don\'t like working, Amazon is great."" Or ""The people who complain were just trying to find something to hate."" Those reviews are usually written by people who have never had family/life issues come up and complicate things or give Amazon a reason to say they\'re useless. In December of 2019, I got a severe case of Bronchitis that I most likely caught from one of my co-workers who was to afraid to stay home cause they were sick, simply out of fear they would be fired cause Amazon doesn\'t do sick days. Anyway, I worked through my sickness as well, or at least tried to. On one particular day I worked, I couldn\'t function and ended up having a temperature of 101.8, my manager knew it and ""checked"" on me several times. Every time he came over, I asked if he could me VTO me so I could go home without getting in trouble, and his response every time was no. I went to onsite AmCare several times, and even our the WHS supervisor and our onsite nurse (actual EMT with medical training) couldn\'t approve me to go home, even though they both took my temperature and saw that I shouldn\'t be there. I finally had enough and used my UPT"
Amazon,1fg5r9t52o15m801,3,The fulfilment jobs are awful. Toxic,Fulfillment Associate,"Unbelievable the amount of toxic behavior at these fulfilment center. The main issues are the managers. they are awful, fake and they favorize between employees. I would sometimes be taken to back to work the at an area that's not in my description which was harder and they would leave others to do our work. I have so much anxiety from this place. "
Amazon,1fg5qmu3jsa1l800,4,"Good Company, not a bad job if you need the money...",Sortation Associate,"I don't understand why some people complain about it, didn't you read the job description? I used to have a great job before covid19 in hospitality business, it's over for now. I am an immigrant, not degree, non special skills, not really hard working. I checked my options: Uber, agriculture, construction, landscaping, road pavement, cleaning, housekeeping...and a lot of other options worse than Amazon. This warehouse job was ok, flexible schedule, payment was fair, labor was ok... Not micro management, nobody rushing you, good coworkers, even opportunities to grow."
Amazon,1fg5m5n2r3kji000,2,"overly stressful,  low standards (at my location)",Warehouse Worker,I had a really bad experience working for Amazon at the particular warehouse i was at. Way too many packages were crammed into containers with no care whatsoever and by the end of the night stuff was all over the floor. The job requires basic organization skills and the majority of people i worked with didn't care enough to put in any effort. Management could have done much more to even out the work-load and respect those that work hardest.
Amazon,1fg5kd1g4hie4801,5,Fun,Warehouse Associate,"Fun job, but if you're not a part of the good ole boys, you will not be promoted. A lot of young leadership that doesn't fully understand how to lead. "
Amazon,1fg5hjm223kji002,5,Great place,Picker/Stower,This is the most fun I've ever had on a job. Amazon is great and all aspects. They make it fun everyday that you go in they're always giving you free lunches and the pay is extraordinary compared to some of the other warehouses in this area. I would highly recommend anyone to go to Amazon to work it's the funnest job you'll ever have
Amazon,1fg54p9umpi92802,2,"Okay if you're looking to get a job, hardly a career",Former Inbound personnel / Former Customer Returns personnel,"If you\'re looking to get some cash fairly quickly, sure, work here. They always need people because of the sheer volume of stuff that management has to split between 10-50 people at any given day. I used to work at the extra-large items facility, and though I can\'t say I was displeased with the work, it\'s more that while the work was never particularly difficult, the upper management often made it more difficult- which is not an unheard-of story for most places. Inbound is easy enough, put stuff on a pallet and wrap it in plastic to keep it stable, great, easy, right? Putting all the stuff away, not so easy when you\'re trying to actually ""prioritize safety and employee well-being"". Stuff is hanging out of the shelving units? Eh, just report it to someone and your boss will get somebody on it, eventually. Though in my case, most immediate problems aren\'t usually something that people take care of, you kind of have to do it yourself and take a hit on your faster-than-human rate of 15 items an hour put away with little-to-no space for said pallets of items. Oh, and did I mention having to compete against all of your other co-workers for said space? It doesn\'t matter, because as long as you\'re getting your work done, it doesn\'t matter what happens to anybody else. Need to lift something over 50 pounds? You\'re better risking pulling a muscle or something, because in the time that somebody can get there when everyone is busy will be the same amount of time that you drag something off the pallet, across the floor, and into whatever godforsaken six-inch hole on top of a barely holding"
Amazon,1fg51hqkshie4801,4,Set your own hours,Amazon Warehouse Associate,Not for everyone. Definitely a physical job . Great benefits and bonuses. Not too sure I would go back though the management favors certain employees and let's them stand around while everyone else is picking up the slack.
Amazon,1fg4rq1cohie4800,4,Nice Team,Delivery Warehouse Team Member,"We are expected to work hard and fast. It would help if we were able make judgement decisions to get the job done more effectively. Especially, when you have deadlines and the managers are not available when a quick decision needs to be made."
Amazon,1fg4rae9hu412802,3,Ok for a Temp job or 2nd job,Warehouse Sorter,My only problem with this job was that Management was always telling us that more hours would be available and that never happened. They continued to hire every week even though most current employees could not get enough hours. If you are not available to pick up shifts as soon as they are released then you wont get any hours. Hard work and management has favorites who always get the hours and win the prizes offered. I left bc the  main department manager was rude and disrespectful to me with no reason.
Amazon,1fg4peq9rs7mv800,3,Exactly what you'd expect,Warehouse Associate,It's not a terrible place to work. Sometimes management is horrible and the HR at my site was terrible but the people that you meet are great and it's an easy job to get and keep as long as you're doing your job.

Amazon,1fg46473chie4801,4,Pay,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Not a good place for an overthinker. Management will not be the most helpful but it's difficult for them to be involved when they're kept busy. Gotta have rest to be able to make it through a whole shift. 
Amazon,1fg3vvvnbu428800,1,Horrible work environment. 0/10,Zone Lead,Stay far away unless truly desperate. Overworked and underpaid expect to be miserable the entire time. Management pretends they\xe2\x80\x99re still in the military but it\xe2\x80\x99s just a grocery store lol
Amazon,1fg3tjub9sa1l800,1,Number crunchers,Warehouse Associate/Shipping,"You can work your butt off and they want you to do more. The breaks are short, and if you don't have 2 inches of padding in your shoes, you end up walking like a duck in pain. "
Amazon,1fg3sm2h3hie4802,1,Horrible place to work at,Area Manager,"Management does not care about supporting you, only cares about cost. Resources are low, running off a skeleton crew, need more process assistants, learning trainers, and yard marshals just to name a few."
Amazon,1fg3nk7tss7mv802,3,Eh.. it's a job and a paycheck... Not much else,Delivery Driver,"Being a delivery driver for Amazon isn't the worst thing in the world, but it's also not something you want to make a long-term career out of either. The DSP I work for is pretty cool and laid back, but the job itself can be physically taxing. I will say, though, that it is a great way to get exercise and lose weight. Overall, the long hours, high amount of stops and packages, lack of benefits, low pay, and wear and tear on your body make the job not worth it.. I would advise anyone considering this job to either find something else, or only do it until something better comes along.. This job is NOT a career by any means... "
Amazon,1fg3g4fbdoc8k801,3,Good temporarily,Warehouse Worker,The pay is not worth the drain on your mental and physical energy  I was there for almost a year. I was trained to do everything but was still getting paid the same as somebody who walked in. If they find out your good at something they will work you to the bone just to reach their numbers. Especially when their short staffed
Amazon,1fg3acv9shie4802,5,The day goes by fast,Sortation Associate,Second income for me. Perfect for someone who loves fast pace work. You also must take your time and job seriously as it being very busy and having a high volume of production.
Amazon,1fg39t8jcu412800,3,Fast pace,Amazon Warehouse Associate,Fast paced. Short breaks.  Long hours or to little of hours. Great time off in place. As well as overtime. You need overtime ? Its ALWAYS available.  
Amazon,1fg37v6l9oc8k800,4,Productive & fun place to work,Fulfillment Associate,"A seasonal employee who returns year after year is known as a boomerang. My first year at Amazon was several years before Covid-19. I lived 3 miles away which made for an easy commute. There were several shifts to choose from and they were very lenient when it came to being tardy or taking time off. If I was 5 minutes late I could deduct 5 minutes from my pay without getting any points. Every week we get free cupcakes and snacks. During the summer that we had cookouts and food trucks. The cafeteria also contained video game machines ping pong foosball you name it anything to entertain us or distract us to make it a fun atmosphere. Before the $15 pay raise the bonuses were paid above whatever the amount was so if it was a $50 bonus they give you say 68 so after taxes you get $50.  Perks like that disappeared when the pay was bumped up to $15 to start.But after COVID-19 the fun kind of fizzled away. More tables were added with less chairs, less lockers. I don't recall seeing any games the last time I was there. "
Amazon,1fg37m0i8oc8k801,4,"Mind numbing work, but you get higher than average pay",Stower/Packer,"It was very hard at first, but as my feet got used to standing for 10 hours straight it was tolerable.  The work(stowing) is very monotonous and mind numbing, really the only thing that keeps me sane are podcasts.  I work only four days out of the week so the nice three day weekend is nice.  Also from what I've heard from others is growth is fairly rare.  The biggest benefits are pay is reliable, they hire you quickly, and they hire anyone who can do the work.  Pay is also higher than others that would hire me with the limited credentials I have."
Amazon,1fg3799p7sa1l800,5,Really good,Game Specialist,"They Support you, give you time, vacations, time for you to spend with your family, This company is really committed to give their employees a great time."
Amazon,1fg33dtjk3kji002,3,Productive,Warehouse Associate,Working here has been A lot of work. When I read the reviews a lot of it shows long hours but little employee recognition as well as little pay compared to all the hard work being put in.
Amazon,1fg2rbuf2u428801,3,Make sure to get in good with the management clicks ,Inbound Stow,"Very clickish.  Peers that you work with change daily. Extremely hot in building. You are just part of the herd. Everyone comes and goes at the same time, same with breaks.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t stop to take a drink of water or use the restroom! They say it\xe2\x80\x99s okay, but frowned upon."
Amazon,1fg2ns05soc8k802,2,You're just a number,Warehouse Associate,"Working amazon was one of the worst experiences ive ever had. Every day walking into that building made me feel super uneasy and I wpuld think of some of the most outrageous ways I could get out of there. Its monotonous repetitive and dull. You work like a slave and don't get enough breaks. You have a quota to meet so if you need to use the restroom, you will miss that quota mark since it takes 5 minutes just to walk to a bathroom since the building is so big. "
Amazon,1fg2kl9i1hie4802,3,Great money,Process Assistant,Poor management too much favoritism. Want you to treat associates like robots. If you speak your mind and stand up to management they label you as a troublemaker. Transferred me to a department I never worked in with a half day of training. Asked to transfer back to where I came from they refused.
Amazon,1fg2js849oc8k800,1,It’s a lot going on ,Amazon Fresh Associate,"amazon is definitely not the move y\xe2\x80\x99all , the practices are very shady and just overall not worth it at all for what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing at this job so yeah that\xe2\x80\x99s all i gots to say"
Amazon,1fg2jk49n3kji002,3,"Very Fast paced, Customers Reviews, ",Driver,"This job is what you make it. It can be fun at times. But it is very fast paced. Heavy lifting. You are judged for everything from wearing a seat belt to go 15 feet, to a customer wasnt happy with how you walked from the mailbox to the door. Weather can really SUCK but the packages still have to be delivered.Things I liked seeing dogs (the friendly ones), sunsets, sometimes cool houses. The crew of drivers we had were nice. Management not so much. Sometimes it was like the hunger games for a route. You dont always have the same route which can suck if you get a route down for 6 weeks then in the middle are thrown somewhere new. So again its what you make of it.Best advice I can give you is what someone told me about routes and that is ""Its never as hard as it looks and never as easy as it seems."
Amazon,1fg2hdlolhie4800,1,Horrible ,Warehouse Associate,"I dreaded coming in to work everyday. I like jobs with rotation, critical thinking and problem solving. I did the same thing everyday which was pack and rebin items. I was promised a position as a problem solver by the management because of my civil engineering background. This was false. I hated working there. Its an easy job but not a job I\xe2\x80\x99d work for a long period of time."
Amazon,1fg2fskdqo15m800,3,Great benefits on one side and long and exhausting hours on the other,wharehouse worker,"It is a fair place to work at if one is needing a job ASAP(they will hire basically anyone who can pass a drug test). The benefits offered are very good, including time off policies. However, most jobs in the warehouses are extremely repetitive and will not teach you anything that could apply somewhere else. It is a warehouse but it functions basically as a factory(with a production line, repetitive jobs, timed breaks and long hours)."
Amazon,1fg2cu1l5o15m801,2,Very independent and long,Warehouse Worker,"Before the first day we had to watch multiple videos and take a short quiz on what we learned from the videos. First day there we went into a room and watch more videos then went down to the floor with a training ambassador and they showed us what to do and that was pretty much it. That's all the training you get, at least for my location & position. I was outbound docks so i had to scan packages and put them on a pallet or cart then deliver said cart to a certain area and repeat. Simple and easy right? Maybe simple but not easy. At least not for 10-12 hours. We had 2 30 minute breaks and somewhere somehow multiple new associates were misinformed about our second break. We were told to clock out for both breaks when in reality we were only supposed to clock out for one since the second is a paid break. We get 10 hours of PTO(paid time off) a year. At the end of my first week i only had 4 hours of PTO when i should've had 6 even though i clocked out for the second break. After you lose a certain amount of hours HR will talk to you because its a reason for termination. long story short a lot of new associates hours were messed up bc we were misinformed, and because of that we lost money and no one would fix it.On top of that we were never told who our managers were. just told to go to a training ambassador or straight to HR or someone in a different colored vest.I ended up switching to inducts after a week because i liked doing that more. for that position you just take a package that comes from this big conveyor belt and position it a certain way on another conveyor belt. That's"
Amazon,1fg27b54p3kji000,5,Fun to work and a lot of opportunity. ,Warehouse Associate,"I worked for amazon for almost 2 and half years and I enjoyed every time I clocked in. Management is fair enough, and the workplace culture is friendly and welcoming. "
Amazon,1fg25oq7poc8k802,3,Expect you to be a robot,Warehouse Associate - Ambassador,"Pay was decent, but they expect you to hit outrageous goals and do not care if you are dealing with personal issues. They expect you to be a robot and hit your productivity goals no matter what. They have a high turnover and a revolving door. Benefits were good though."
Amazon,1fg22gg1uu412802,1,Worst place,Warehouse Worker,"I believe Amazon has more potential but they make things hard. It's like you are a robot. You don't feel like you belong there, that you are just a number a not a person that needs to work, make money and probably grow within the company, but that's not the case."
Amazon,1fg20hfrmu412801,2,Amazon.com,Sr. HRA,Not the best place to work if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like the rat race. The company is very one sided and make promoting difficult. Work life balance is unfortunately non-existent.
Amazon,1fg1tqkttu412800,1,"Terrible turnover, easily replaced by new employees ",Warehouse Worker,"So many employees are unhappy, but Amazon could care less because they are constantly hiring new people to take the place of everyone that quits. Literally people quit every single day because the pay is horrible and expectations are unreasonable. "
Amazon,1fg1sfr7au428800,3,Wasn’t the best place of work,Customer returns,"Working at Amazon is a real hit or miss, it really depends what warehouse you\xe2\x80\x99re at. Some of them are really involving and seem like they actually care about their workers then others barely care at all. Regardless the work/life balance is alright you get 3 day weekends. The physical aspect of the work environment is either standing for 9 hours or walking around for 9 hours it really depends on if you mind that or not. One of the worst things about working there was the micro management they track how many units you have to put out in an hour they give you speeding tickets if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to fast but they want 1000 units an hour then your breaks are tracked you get 15 minute breaks but it takes about 5 to walk to the exit depending on where you\xe2\x80\x99re at. The social life is terrible there\xe2\x80\x99s no talking on the floor which I can get in some circumstances but not even small talk to the person next to you. The thing that made me get out was the fact I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand being there for 9 hours with nothing to do other than put this box over here and think."
Amazon,1fg19ntp2o29h800,5,Productive ans fub,Warehouse associate,"I like it, Its a place where people with different cultures come and work, I work when I like. My schedule is flexible and there is opportunities for advancement"
Amazon,1fg18b6k6s7mv802,4,It’s a good place to work ,Fulfillment Associate,I\xe2\x80\x99m a packer and it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty self explanatory. Pretty easy work. The good is that you are in your own area no one bothers you. It depends where they need you the most. The bad is that you have to take a long walk to the restroom/break room . Strict on tot.
Amazon,1fg130cbasa1l802,3,Easy work just long hours of nothing ,Warehouse Sorter,Easy work but sometimes managers can\xe2\x80\x99t be a pain especially young ones that take the manager position to the the head and are disrespectful other than that pays is good for what you do but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to move around and advance when they don\xe2\x80\x99t really promote writhing the just hire external from what I see
Amazon,1fg0rc703u428802,4,Great benefits,Picker/Packer,Great place to work at especially if you are an introvert.  Benefits are AMAZING. Work is structured. Yes!!  You DO get bathroom breaks. Amazon treats you like a person and not just like a number.
Amazon,1fg0q3ki9o292802,3,Bad management ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,The managers of course chose favorites and often of course they are girls to be cool with a manager and basically be the ones who do nothing but walk around and talk you have to talk to them and joke with them idk it always made me feel so uncomfortable 
Amazon,1fg08r6qku412802,1,Management ruins it for everyone,Warehouse Associate,"You may think that working for Amazon is cool and fun just because of how big the company is, but DONT DO IT!!!! You will get burnt out and hate it there. Amazon does not care about you, they only care about making rate and pushing out all of the packages they need to. They constantly look at employees as numbers (even if they deny that they do). Management absolutely do not care about you, they will act like they do but they actually don't, because like i said before they only care about making rate. There are very few people at my warehouse that actually enjoy being there and the reason is management. They care more about getting the packages out then the employees taking breaks."
Amazon,1fg07und9hie4800,1,"One of the Worst Places Ive ever worked, managment is VERY bloated","Warehouse Associate, VRC Manager","They also treat employees like machines... barely enough time to go to the bathroom.Terrible working conditions, almost like an American sweatshop.Almost no concern or protection from COVID, more work, and harder hours.Pay is negligible, advancement in nil..."
Amazon,1ffvrjhr43kji001,2,Use you up and throw you away,Area Manager,"They will get all the productivity out of you and when they are done with you it\xe2\x80\x99s out the door! Turn your back on upper management and they will find something, don\xe2\x80\x99t make it two years get ready to pay back your relo."
Amazon,1ffvno0euhie4801,5,It’s a good job if you work at a smaller site ,Warehouse Worker,My site is small and the managers are really chill it\xe2\x80\x99s not too much work just long hours and standing like most jobs. Recently they have been more strict about badge swipes but if you come back to break on time you\xe2\x80\x99re good! 
Amazon,1ffvgc45ihie4800,5,Work Life Balance,Transportation Associate,"I like Amazon,  great opportunity for anyone just starting out, getting back on their feet, or wanting something to do during retirement. Managers can be annoying but only because there are people pushing them to treat us like robots"
Amazon,1ffvct704hie4801,4,Easy job to make money ,Packer,"The job was really easy, but there is no sense of growing. It feels like you're just stagnated in the job and every day is almost the same. And production always has to be met."
Amazon,1ffvbnj21oc8k801,4,Its alright if you want something flexible,Prime Now Shopper,"Very flexible, this is as an Amazon prime shopper though. You can work whenever you want, but it's hard to get a shift.  You basically have to fight to get a shift, and the only requirement is that you have to work at least 3 times a month. Its a good job as a part time. "
Amazon,1ffvaj3b3hie4802,4,Not sure,Warehouse Associate,"Job isn't all that bad, decent hours and wage for what you do. It could always be work. I've been with them for about 4 years now and there hasn't been much change or improvement."
Amazon,1ffung309u412800,1,If You Are A Level 5 Or Below You Are Cattle ,Controls System Lead,"Amazon does not care about you or anyone you work with. They only care about how much money they are making. Sad because there is so much potential at a large company with so many different fields of work. Unfortunately if you are going to be working in a large building like MQY1 you better pray to God that you have a great manager. Otherwise you will be over worked and under paid. I have been working a mandatory 60hrs a week for the past 5 months, and was asked to work 70hrs. If you are looking for a Controls Job they are open here for a reason. Complete waste of a year working here. "
Amazon,1fful84cuoc8k801,4,Good place to work at,Warehouse Team Member,"Not a bad place to work at the pay was good, the environment was good, and taking time off was easy to claim. Managers were alright they prioritized production over safety at times."
Amazon,1ffuf30o6oc8k801,2,Its amazon,Sortation Associate:Seasonal,Hard physical labor for less than a warehouse job should pay. Fellow staff were actually nice and had a sense of comradery. They should stop bragging about 15/hour. In Socal that's just above minimum wage lol
Amazon,1ffu1ahe0sa1l802,4,Fast Past,Sorter/Packer,Very Fast pace working environment but pay is good. Flexible Schedule . Manger wise it is not so good. Seniority does play a role in word load. New people pick all the slack.
Amazon,1fftpi6b9u428801,4,Good place to work,Delivery Route Driver,"Not much room for advancement. You just delivered freight. As long as you showed up on time everyday, and did your job, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a problem. The problem was has upper management, I.e. Amazon logistics ran the routes. They were still trying to figure out the most effective way to run them, and you were constantly being switched to different routes. And that was the major issue. But, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind that, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad place to work at all. I really did enjoy my job, and I did enjoy meeting a lot of different people out on the route.  "
Amazon,1fftom4kehie4802,3,Aburrido,Order Picker,Hacen muchas expsiones de personal para hacer el trabajo facil
Amazon,1fftmplu1o292802,5,The company is a great one to work for.,Warehouse Associate,"Amazon is a great company to work for. They pay great, the benefits are good. You can make great friends. If you are hired fo not think that your job is secure, anything can and will get you fired if it is in the books."
Amazon,1fftmjgof3kji002,2,Very rough,Warehouse Worker,"If you don\xe2\x80\x99t like standing on your feet for five hours a day and constantly have someone on your a** for taking a short break to sit down, then don\xe2\x80\x99t work here! "
Amazon,1fftjghtnu428800,1,Very slave like.  Not too much support,Packer/Shipper,Very few breaks and too much hustle to then stop for hours on production. The rules and culture led to many people leaving or failing at work. Lack of management or control is a constant
Amazon,1ffti9ncvoc8k800,4,"Good job, health benefits on the first day. ",Package Handler,"Healthcare benefits start on the first day, and I really, really appreciated that being in shipping. Other companies, like UPS, take 9 months to start healthcare benefits (a reason I left). Also, there are opportunities to move from part-time to full-time that come up frequently. Management can be difficult to deal with, but if you do your work they will leave you alone. "
Amazon,1ffth6saio29h801,2,"Heavy work, high expectations, low compensation",Overnight Associate,"Not the best place to work. ""Competitive"" pay but not worth it considering the amount of work that is expected. The nature of work is very repetitive."
Amazon,1fftfij4osa1l801,2,Physical job,Stower,"Working at Amazon is very physical job. They pay and benefits are great, but standing for 12 hours in one spot might not be the best thing for someone. "
Amazon,1fft8d5mmoc8k800,3,"Was bland not much, ",Inventory Specialist,"Basic warehouse, boxes, orders, walking and walking to get numbers, long hours some days and pay was not good for the time and numbers you have to do, body breaking"
Amazon,1fft5qkrpu428801,4,Get to work with a lot of people ,Shipping Clerk,"A great company, many benefits, many areas to further career or change career with alot, alot, alot of opportunities if you look around. Waiting for someone to help you move up is not going to happen, but with initiative you can go very far.Because there are so many opportunities, sometime groups of people, will leave a location for opportunities, alot of turnover because you can move around. If you are not strong, you can get lost in the shuffle.The majority of amazon workers never search through the company app, there is a resources section, internal and external job portal. So alot of people are always wondering how to move up and assume they have to wait for a manager to hold their hand.Just use the portal and apply for jobs, even from day 1."
Amazon,1fft4ai3cs7mv801,5,Great source of extra income and flexible work schedule ,Picker/Packer,"This is only a part time position. Great place to work if you need a lot of flexibility in your work schedule. However if you want a solid schedule, this may not be the job for you, as you pick your own hours to work (granted they are available) max you can work is 20-25 hours, with it going above that during peak season. However once again, just because you want the hours doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it will be available! Most people snatch up the hours the minute they are available, so its kind of like a competition of first come first serve. This is more of a second source of income rather than your main bread and butter. This job was extremely convenient for me and low-stress. "
Amazon,1fft0dtmiu428802,5,Lots to do ,Stower,"I felt like a robot, doing the same thing everyday I wanted to do more than just put stuff away for other people to pick pack and deliver. I understand the importance of it but it was not for me "
Amazon,1ffss3vk5u412802,4,"Nice pay, flexible time off",Customer Service Associate,The only con I have for Amazon really would be how entitled people are getting from our customer obsession. Most of the time the people we help are thankful and kind; but sometimes there\xe2\x80\x99s the really hateful customers who demand way too much for a problem fix.
Amazon,1ffspkpsdhie4801,1,Not a good job at all,Amazon Warehouse Associate,Terrible work life balance. Managers don\xe2\x80\x99t care. No sense of purpose. You are basically a robot from the second you enter the doors. Worst work experience ever. 
Amazon,1ffsk6ma7sa1l802,4,Good source of income if just starting to get onto your feet ,Fulfillment Associate,"Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend the long term In amazon but if your advancing I would say stay, also if your trying to save a certain amount I highly recommend because of the weekly pay. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay forever if your just looking for work management is shiesty depending on location ."
Amazon,1ffseiprso29h802,4,"The job isn’t hard , but for the job it could be better pay ",Amazon Warehouse Associate,"Break amounts could be better , programs for families  with sick children could be more beneficial.  Having someone you could actually speak with would help a lot. Missing your break just because you have to go down stairs to speak to HR."
Amazon,1ffs30gbeu428802,4,Going place ,Warehouse Associate,Good place to work wether  you have experience or not and there a ways you can advance very quickly with Amazon. Starting pay is 15$ And you get paid weekly. 
Amazon,1ffrisi7dsa1l800,4,"Good benefits, lots of repeated manual work",Warehouse associate,"Pay can be rewarding, but expect a lot of work that is always logged per hour. If you can keep a solid sleep schedule and you have good enough physique to do the same thing for 10-12 hours a day, this is for you. "
Amazon,1ffrhnh92u428802,3,It's fine.,Inbound Stower,"I like working here but at the same time it's extremely unfulfilling. You aren't supposed to listen to headphones or go on your phone but I do anyway because if not, I would have quit a long time ago or lost my mind due to the mind numbingly boring work. It's extremely repetitive and you are on your feet for long hours. I like it because people leave you alone and even though leadership will bug you about your mistakes or low productivity, these seem to be empty threats. I have unparalleled flexibility in my schedule so this is the best option for me at this point. I hope to get out of here soon though."
Amazon,1ffrgauqpoc8k800,3,It was okay,Warehouse Worker,"It was a fast paced environmnent, but it was a good first job. I'd get experience, then get out. The management wasn't that supportive and it gets tiring, but you may get used to it."

If you are not strong, you can get lost in the shuffle.The majority of amazon workers never search through the company app, there is a resources section, internal and external job portal.

Amazon,1ffoji5auhie4800,4,"Amazon, what else can I say",Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"Amazon, you hate it or love it. Not much of a middle ground in many aspects. Its a good company to work for, depending on how management for your building is. Amazon does invest into its employees a lot more than people say, but also it feels like they expect more out of us than we can realistically provide. I got lucky and found a building where the team works with me, others aren't so lucky."
Amazon,1ffoj8vh9u428802,1,Amazon is not the best place to work,Sortation Associate,"Like many reviewers, I feel that there are too many cliques with management; if you have a problem with one, they all team up against you. Management is mostly unqualified, they play favorites, and they couldn't care less about you as a person. The workdays are long and the work is very physically demanding and will wear you down pretty quickly. You're only given two days of unpaid time off during a 3 month period. The turnover is incredibly high, and when we're short handed, which happens often, mandatory extra time is given and HR couldn't care less if you can work it or not... you have to work it.  "
Amazon,1ffoj58rchie4801,3,Ok,Fulfillment Associate,Ok place to work. It is good pay and benefits. Also flexible scheduling based on your building. Leadership is always good. They are very helpful. It is a job.

Amazon,1ffoipn5eo29h802,3,Constantly Busy,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"This is a pro and a con.  There is always work to be done so if you are someone who enjoys taking on overtime and not having a dull moment at work, this is great.  If you are someone who like to have a life outside of work this can be a problem because during holidays you basically live at work and even some normal shifts the management team will ask and even have mandatory overtime.  On the plus side the work is very straight forward, but can be physically demanding at times."

Amazon,1ffo83v43hie4802,3,Fast paced environment ,Associate,"I've been a warehouse employee for a few months and the first two weeks was draining me because I had to walk around 10km every 10 hour shift.

Amazon,1ffo6kgpos7mv802,4,Good Company to Advance in,Tier 1 Associate,So far this has been a very easy job.

Better than some, but you\xe2\x80\x99re expected to do a lot for what they offer. The mandatory extra time (MET) is just cruel. Understandable for the holidays, but when it\xe2\x80\x99s happening year round, it gets old real quick. Not worth the headache. Everyone, except management, is absolutely miserable."
Amazon,1ffo0t454hie4801,1,Under paid and over worked,Associate,"Management treats employees like robots. The managers are often hired without prior warehouse experience so they don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what they\xe2\x80\x99re asking us to do is not possible. They are more worried about numbers than keeping the environment safe. Bad communication between dock and lanes, too many packages are being sent at once and then we get in trouble for not picking fast enough or we have to bury ourselves in packages which is dangerous. Management is terrible at communication and is extremely unorganized."
Amazon,1ffntuh83u412802,2,Incompetent management and toxic work culture,Area Manager,"Poor management structure in FC's, and often haphazard communication between shifts and departments of new deliverables and/or practices. My management peers would look down on associates. Many firings of associates were justified, but the joy from peers in management when firing associates was repulsive. Incompetence was not restricted to my FC, but I heard operational and logistics stories from peers in other newly opened FC's. Covid safety guidelines were not enforced or practiced by upper management. The work is also not fulfilling, so there is immense turnover. Some days we'd have to come in 1-1.5 hrs early and leave 1-1.5 hours after shift. I will finish by adding that I've heard COMPLETELY opposite and AMAZING experiences from other FC's. I would avoid newly made FC's."
Amazon,1ffnrlj59u412802,5,Pay,Amazon Associate,"Amazon is a great company to work for ! You are compensated for your hard work; however, I wish the breaks were longer. Being on your feet all day long with only 30 minutes in between including the time you walk from & to your station"
Amazon,1ffnn6ms9u428800,3,"There was no interview which is always a plus, the hours were flexible, the supervisors were ok, breaks were given",Package Handler/Sorter,"Overall It was a decent company to work for. The hours make it possible for you to only have that job and still be able to handle outside business outside of work. Also since it\xe2\x80\x99s usually a part time position, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to have a second job because only working there may not be enough to pay household expenses."

Amazon,1ffmsr5gqoc8k800,3,Should pay more for workers in different areas,Inbound Receiving Clerk,"Working there two years ago they gave everyone at every Amazon the base wage of 15, which is cool. But I feel if cost of living is higher in your area you should be paid more. In California, minimum wage is a lot higher than other states. "
Amazon,1ffmnkmtuu428801,3,Good pay but very tedious work,Amazon Warehouse Associate,Pay was really good but it was very tedious and not very fun to work. You are put in your station alone and do repetitive hand motions while standing for 10 hours with two 30 minute breaks in between. You get free hot chocolate though and raffles every week
Amazon,1ffmn9tt2o29h800,1,Problems with Training,Editor,"I was there for a short time as a contractor, and I couldn't do the job they required because of the failure of Amazon to ship me equipment, poor training, and flaws in the training material. The failure to ship equipment was almost understandable, with everyone working from home and things being chaotic from COVID-19, but it cost me several days when I should have been at work. The training was not relevant to my required work and had significant errors in the tutorial for the CMS the role required. Furthermore, management was creating the rules for CMS implementation as the project went along. Working for Amazon was the most frustrating job I have had because I tried to communicate to management that the tutorial did not address my actual work duties and had fatal errors preventing me from learning what I needed to learn to pass the material. The most discouraging thing about working at Amazon was I had to pass the training course even though it was unrelated to my actual work. Another frustration was the CMS used for the job because it is clunky and outdated, requiring hand-coding of links in the CMS. It was as if no one had heard of a WYSIWYG CMS. Management was nice and pleasant to work with, but training could have been better as well as improvements to the CMS. I didn't last at my job at Amazon, but I'm not sad about it. I won\xe2\x80\x99t ever apply for an Amazon job again because there are better, less frustrating jobs and places to work."
Amazon,1ffmmqm3hhie4802,1,Terrible place to work ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend Amazon to my worst enemy.after working there for about 7 months I was interested in an internal transfer.

Amazon,1ffmbjplpu412800,1,"0 Stars, this place is awful ",Supervisor,"They don't care about their people. The work environment is awful. It's hot, and filthy, and largely unsafe. The hours are long. Even for being one of the top performers, and having been with the company for 4 years, there are not bonuses or recognition for going above and beyond. It definitely takes a toll on your body. But the emotional abuse is far worse. The morale is so bad here. I 100% would never recommend this job to my worst enemy. "

Amazon,1ffm4as8pu428802,3,Poor work environment ,FC Associate I,"I\xe2\x80\x99ve met some great people here, but management makes this place almost unbearable. The high turnover rate speaks for itself. Things are constantly changing and leadership does a poor job of communicating these changes with associates from shift to shift. Majority of the managers won\xe2\x80\x99t acknowledge you unless it\xe2\x80\x99s to reprimand or micromanage your every move. Safety hazards are constantly ignored because all focus is on productivity. Covid-19 protocols are nothing more than a front at this point. It\xe2\x80\x99s all about numbers here, so don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to work here and feel like you matter as an individual. I would recommend milking this job for all it\xe2\x80\x99s worth and moving on to better things when the opportunity arises."
Amazon,1ffm2nm8gu412802,5,Fun work place,Sortation Associate,"Easy, pay good, I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of nothing bad to say\xe2\x80\xa6.If you want to work for a multi-national company and deliver excellent customer service, then Amazon is the place for you! You'll join a team of enthusiastic, passionate and capable employees in the warehouse; with plenty of opportunity opportunities for progression. What's more, it's a universally great place to work!"
Amazon,1ffm03d4ho292802,1,"Good Benefits, bad pay",Picker/Packer,"Work alone at your station all day for the the first 2-3 months until given opportunity of advancement, pay is very low for how much they expect from you. Great job for those who prefer working alone. Very physically taxing...did moving job on side and workout and am active and was exhausted after end of day."
Amazon,1fflrodavhie4800,3,"A place to work with full benefits, but that's about it.",Warehouse Associate,"A lot can be said for the way Amazon hires and fires it's employees. You can get a job in a min as a tier 1 associate in the warehouse. In a pinch it's not as bad as the crazy stories you hear in the media. You get reasonable breaks and yes you can go use the restroom during the shift. Management aren't monsters, but Amazon likes to hire fresh out of college people for the management rolls it fills. You will get a new manager every few months which is frustrating.Working in pack in the warehouse isn't fun or glamorous. It's not supposed to be. If you come in every day and swing for the fences trying to have the best rate all the time you will burn out. It's a mind numbingly boring job that pays a couple dollars less a hour than all the other warehouse jobs in Denver. You can look at it one of two ways. 1. A very temporary job to work to pay bills and apply to things you are better suited to or whatnot. Or 2. You can stick around and use Amazon as a spring board for further education. They do have some good programs for tuition reimbursement and in house schooling. It's worth looking into if you want to change careers. My advice if you decide to take a warehouse associate job at Amazon is to have a clear plan for what you want to do career wise. Choose one of the two options I listed above. Otherwise, you will get stuck making less money, not progressing in life, and living paycheck to paycheck just getting by. It's a bad look. I hope some of this helped someone. "
Amazon,1fflrb61phie4801,3,It’s good and fast money,Picker,"They hire almost anybody and they do it quickly so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely something to do. The hours are long but,the money is good and the work is not too bad. All in all, a decent job."
Amazon,1fflqaa8qsa1l800,4,HR contact center,Human Resources Assistant II,Was a good job but ultimately I left due to position being in a fairly new department and was unorganized in my opinion. The pay & benefits were good. If I hear of things changing within that department I would reapply!

Amazon,1fflnfhnku412802,4,Most horror stories are overblown,Tier III Process Assistant,"Most of the horror stories you see online about working in an amazon warehouse are overblown, exaggerated or outright manufactured. The expectations are not unreasonable.I worked at several different amazon facilities and they were night and day difference between the ease of working with management. At one building management did a phenomenal job of team support, were approachable and easy to work with. At another, the management from bottom tier to the upper level was toxic, hostile, hypocritical and quick to rush to throw anyone else under the bus (or they themselves would be thrown their by their superiors).  This will obviously vary building by building, but the stories about people running 14+ shifts, peeing in bottles, unable to take breaks etc  should be taken with a grain of salt, they come from disgruntled employees who know that narrative will be given a spotlight in the media"
Amazon,1ffln720eu412801,1,Don’t do it if you enjoy feeling your legs,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"Nah, it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth it chief. They only promote if you have a manager in your pocket, even then it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen often. Most of the people don\xe2\x80\x99t work, so if you work hard you end up having to shoulder the load. "

Amazon,1ffliqqn2u412800,2,It wasn’t for me. ,Picker,"My experience wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good. By the end of my first week, I had a breakdown and everyone kept telling me that it\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fine. I was barely functioning mentally and physically because of the long 10 hour shifts. My body was in so much pain and my mental & emotional health was effected. I felt like no one cared that I was a few seconds away from breaking down because of the pressure to do my job. "
Amazon,1fflhp9klu428800,4,It’s ok,Warehouse Associate,Pay is pretty good for entry level. Job isn\xe2\x80\x99t too bad just boring. Been working here 2 years as a small female and I\xe2\x80\x99ve lasted. Just be mentally disciplined for the boredom but I personally feel it\xe2\x80\x99s worth it.
Amazon,1fflfgd2psa1l802,4,Nice job ,Sortation Associate,"It is great working here at Amazon. Job can be fast paced at time but, hours can fluctuate due to volume so, you might not get enough hours for the week. Some managers show favoritism to tenured employees. "
Amazon,1ffldh8nuhie4801,4,Amazon ok management but good people,Tier 1 Associate,"Overall for the money, it\xe2\x80\x99s a decent job. There is a lack of management training that leads to a trickle down problem of no real leadership as most are just trying to hide that they have no support from above and lack the knowledge they need to help. There is a fair argument that they do like to promote and hire certain stereotypes that live in their own self absorbed bubble...these seem to flourish at Amazon as the better managers often leave to other companies and high turnover of good workers and a high retention of those just skating by. For the money, a decent job, but not a real career place. Practical skills, advancement, and lifelong knowledge aren\xe2\x80\x99t pat of the Amazon experience...good mangers that move on to other opportunities that call you up to join them might be the only hidden perk."
Amazon,1fflc1kfvhie4802,3,Typical Call Center,VCS,"Managers are very hit or miss, you can have a great one or one who bullies you.

Amazon,1ffl919gchie4802,4,Flexible time off ,Customer Service,I loved the flexible time off options. Pay is fair for the work being done. Management moves around a lot so it was hard to build a relationship with a manager before they were moved to another department. 
Amazon,1ffl7kfgj3kji002,4,"Long hours, great benefits",Warehouse Associate,"A normal shift is 10 hours, but they do have mandatory overtime which can lengthen your shift. Usually 4 days a week, and 3 days off. Management is usually new graduates with no warehouse experience which can make them less empathetic to the hard work we do. The culture is great & everyone is accepted."

Amazon does not care.... at all. They will never promote you, and the pay cap is a joke. As a CDL driver, I was paid the same rate as a packer in the warehouse. When hired on, they will promise the world, but in reality, they will just overwork you while being extremely rude to course you to quit to avoid paying unemployment."

Amazon,1ffkus7iuo29h802,3,Okay,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"It was good starting at 15 until you see how much work there is. Kept you in shape but constantly overworked or mandatory overtime, work morale and management was poor. Saw a lot of people promoted based purely favoritism not work ethic and high turn over rate of employees. I loved working here because of the flexibility of choosing your designated shift when you first apply day shifts, mid shifts or overnight shifts available also if you wanted full time 10 hours for 4 days or part time 8 hours for 3 days. Also appreciated no interview I find it weird when entry level warehouse jobs need interviews"
Amazon,1ffku6qnbo292801,1,Mislead leadership,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"Management treats the workplace like a school. They think music and ""fun"" events like a spirit week makes up for the underpaid and overworked employees. If you leave to use the restroom you will be questioned, as to why you left. Management plays favorites. I saw a managers niece come work and get promoted within 3 months."
Amazon,1ffkqgv4gsa1l802,5,Overall i love working for amazon from home,Amazon Customer Service,Fun and pleasant place to work from home! Easy and they always have good bonuses they care about their employees I love the management and all! Respectful  of their employees  and always motivating. I love it
Amazon,1ffkq2d39sa1l800,2,Just in and out,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"This place wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be bad as a 1-2yr plan but outside of that then you\xe2\x80\x99re having to defend yourself with the rate system plus management on you for little things, not finding them when you need them, and constantly changing new managers. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been there for 8yrs and finally had enough of the stress, fighting to stay afloat, and having to put others under the bus to avoid weekly write ups for rate. "
Amazon,1ffkj9j3ihie4802,5,Good place to work,Inbound Stow,Very good place to work. Good schedules and flexibility. Everybody gets along with each other. Decent pay for the work. Great benefits. Work independently. 
Amazon,1ffkiqc523kji000,2,Very much like a staffing agency ,Senior Corporate Technology Management  Recruiter,Hired as a recruiter only doing sourcing.  Feels very much like working at a staffing agency. All new recruiters start doing only sourcing regardless of experience level. 
Amazon,1ffkg09ddhie4801,5,Great incentives ,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"Great place to work room for advancement , holidays are busy but they reward your hard work. Management is there to make sure your day is successful. Great place "
Amazon,1ffk6gisahie4800,3,Good pay but not for everyone,Warehouse Associate,Amazon has exceptional pay for the work you are doing. The work is more on the boring side so if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like standing around like a zombie then this isn\xe2\x80\x99t for you.
Amazon,1ffk19n03u412802,3,A job where you are constantly moving ,Driver,"You drive all day dropping off packages hoping you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a long shift. The pay\xe2\x80\x99s not bad, better then most jobs but not as great as other delivery companies."
Amazon,1ffju644au412802,4,Overall great place to work with flexibility,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"I can't complain, it's flexible where I can make the money I need and still have a life outside of work. Great benefits and opportunities to advance. Coworkers are pretty good too. "
Amazon,1ffjstk72oc8k802,3,Stable workplace ,Warehouse Associate,Amazon is a stable workplace the only downfall is there is too much favoritism. There is not much space for career growth. If you are looking for a job to get you back up on your feet this is it.
Amazon,1ffjruqcmo292801,2,Talk using high road language but actions take low road. ,Disability and Leave Case Manager,"Employee are too often left in the dark, always worrying whether you are doing something wrong and what that might mean. You can spend a lot of energy wondering if you are following the rules because they change often. When you do something wrong it might be the end of your employment as employees are easily dispensable. Mental health days are needed to keep from getting too stressed. "
Amazon,1ffjrh2ktu412802,3,Training is not good ,Customer Service Representative,You'll train for 2 weeks and be thrown into production with no choice but to sink or swim. Managers will try and say they understand and they will support you while pushing you back on calls.
Amazon,1ffjqeee1o29h802,4,Its okay,Associate,Hard work but the pay was nice. The expectations are ridiculousand you will sweat and work but agaian good pay depends on your work ethic and I quit cause I couldnt
Amazon,1ffjptuouu428800,1,Horrible ,Packer,Okay this has to be the worse job ever. Literally little to no communication low pay long hours standing the entirety time and your pace it tracked by a computer.
Amazon,1ffjpapqpsa1l801,4,"Easy Going, Self Managed",In-Store Shopper,As a prime shopper the compensation for this position was okay. Since we only picked and packed groceries I understand the compensation. Management changed every 6 months so the store was behind on changes that were meant to be made in advance. Because we work in a Whole Foods location we have to deal with them directly which slows down the process of our job a lot. 
Amazon,1ffjnt1ujsa1l801,4,Productive,Sortation Associate,"Great choice of hours, I\xe2\x80\x99m able to work my 20 hours a week in just 3 days and be off for 4 days straight. Overtime is always available and I\xe2\x80\x99m giving the option to use VTO when I want a full weekend off with no penalty. "
Amazon,1ffjfd34v3kji002,4,Productive Rewarding Experience ,TDR Associate,"Team mentality here. Employees band together to get the job done, reach quotas,  and exceed expectations.  Advancement opportunities are there, just need a bit better delivery when it comes to interviewing process. All in all a great workplace!"
Amazon,1ffjeocup3kji002,4,Good Company to start a career ,Yard Specialist,The company is like any other if you are willing to do the work you will be satisfied. Most managers are fair and do recognize the hard work. They try their best to take care of their employees with safety training's. Work schedule allows for good work life balance. Benefits are good. 
Amazon,1ffjejklqo292802,5,Growth potential ,EHS Specialist,Great company that\xe2\x80\x99s not going anywhere . Opportunity is available for growth if you really want it and go for it . A lot of buses going around so try not to fall under one ( not literally) . The longer you are there the more responsibility you have if your an L4 or up . 
Amazon,1ffja0hrbu428801,1,It was a productive and fast place environment and laidback ,Picker,I only worked at Amazon for 3 weeks and i have a lot to say. The work environment was fun but boring and mangers and HR don\xe2\x80\x99t really care about you. They will fire you for no reason. If you ask them why they fired you they won\xe2\x80\x99t even give you a good valid reason. You don\xe2\x80\x99t even sign papers when they terminate you. They are very unorganized and very unprofessional managers don\xe2\x80\x99t even act like managers they\xe2\x80\x99re just there literally. Don\xe2\x80\x99t work for this company at all they act like they care about you but they really don\xe2\x80\x99t. They literally have new policies every freaking day which makes it hard to keep up with your job honestly
Amazon,1ffj7tmb9u428801,4,Great place to work ,Warehouse Worker,Great pay and benefits. Managers micro manage on every little thing. Short breaks suck. Plenty of overtime and incentives to work. All in all its a good place to work.
Amazon,1ffj6tc5vhie4801,4,Wasn't at all bad.,Receiving Associate,"Aside from the repetitious daily job function. It wasn't too bad. Granted it's not bad if you are position in a light station unpacking, stacking, or boxing lightweight  manageable carry items. "
Amazon,1ffj5u2pl3kji001,4,Not bad for a seasonal job,Warehouse Associate,Pretty decent work. Can be long hours but they make up for it by giving you half the week off. No raises unless you plan to move up to management which can be extremely stressful for the pay so it might not be worth it.
Amazon,1ffj4ucvsu412801,3,Not a job for long term,Warehouse Associate,"I worked in a fulfillment center of Amazon (MKE1) for a little over 3 years. I would tell anyone that if you need to make a quick buck for bills then this is a great place, the work is very simple to understand and do (short term) and you get $17-$18 a hour to do it. Now the work may be easy for awhile but this isn\xe2\x80\x99t somewhere you should work years for, at the most 6 months or a year then leave because it gets very tiring and physically demanding and starts to put a toll on your body. You\xe2\x80\x99ll also not have much time or energy to do much else in life working 10 hour shifts of manual labor for 4 days along with half the time working a 5th day for overtime. Not much work life balance. Like I said short term it can be great but don\xe2\x80\x99t stay too long. Management is a revolving door and you\xe2\x80\x99ll only have a manager about 6 months till you get a new one. Also advancement is possible to become an assistant manager (PA) in a year or sometimes less but you only make $1 or $2 more just to still have to lift heavy things, run around everywhere, fix stations and on top of all of that have to deal with your employees attitudes and rude behavior which to me doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem worth it. After a PA position, don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to become a manger because most are hired from outside (college graduates) and making OPS is nearly impossible for the average person with no degree. Just use this place as an in between job to make quick money and get out ASAP! "
Amazon,1ffj43av7u428801,3,Pretty easy job just long hours ,Team Member,"Job is very easy. Wear comfortably shoes though because you\xe2\x80\x99re on your feet the whole time! The job had great pay, but you have to work for the pay. Watch your points! "
Amazon,1ffj1e3f8sa1l802,1,Nothing good ,Loading Dock Supervisor,Just labor No future No shift change unless ur a girl.Just mandatory overtime A whole lot of mandatory overtime Pay increments of less than a dollar a year 
Amazon,1ffj07k3go29h802,3,"Good for career growth, but don't stay for more than 4 years",Senior Software Engineer,"Joined Amazon after college graduation as SDE1, worked 6 years and now SDE3. The work is challenging, and some has tight deadlines that require people to work more hours.Overall a good company to learn and grow, but would not recommend if you want more of personal time.Comp growth internally is 2-5% for me YoY. As a 6 YoE SDE3 I have a lower comp than 3 YOE SDE2. Manager said you just got promoted so you start at the bottom of SDE3 comp bracket, if you leave the company and interview for SDE3 again you won't be bar-raising and thus cannot get avg SDE3 comp. But that cannot explain why I shouldn't quit and interview for SDE2 and get a better comp."
Amazon,1ffivvaci3kji001,2,Rate is a killer,Inbound Stower,"People are friendly enough. Friendly competitions, and scheduled company events (food, giveaways, holidays, etc. ... ). When your feet stop screaming at you in pain in about a week after starting you will find you do not enjoy lounging about as much any more.I admit to shotgun stowing (missed a beep or verified info accepted screen...) I have tried during 2 separate Chrismas Seasons at 2 different AmazonLandCenters. No matter how unfair I think the slavemaster's fast pace is, it is an unreal experience inside any of Amazons warehousesCeners. The robotics, use of automation everywhere, smart lift trucks, shelves come to you Not the other , quaint,  way.  "
Amazon,1ffistpfihie4802,3,It’s a decent job with decent pay,Ship dock,Working long hours with short breaks constantly on your feet coworkers were the best part of the job always joking and helping out when things needed to be done management isn\xe2\x80\x99t really to bad their there but don\xe2\x80\x99t really interact with you only say hi or wave every once in a while working at Amazon thought me to work faster and get more things done in a short amount of time 
Amazon,1ffioh20qhie4802,1,Its a modern day sweatshop. The amount of work expected isnt something that can be sustained for a long period of time.,Sortation,"I don't recommend working at amazon as a warehouse associate. The hours are long, they pay isn't that great and there are too many managers. There are a lot of people who just sit around doing nothing all day."
Amazon,1ffiogl0r3kji002,2,All about smile and having but but not so much ,Picker,Just didnt feel like I belong.... no room for growth... a lot of favoritism going on in the by workplace... even if you are doing good you always get called up to desk for anything. I know of alot of people who either got written up or fired for the littlest things
Amazon,1ffilv88msa1l800,3,Long hours  . No sick time. ,Warehouse Team Member,Long hours  . No sick time. UPT system is a joke. HR's system is horrible and needs work. Amazon also doesn't believe in a phone and everything is through an app. The system is very faulty. I should be able to call my manager.
Amazon,1ffij24ifsa1l801,5,Great ,Order Picker,Great company to work for no complaints. From my friends at this time if anything changes I will make another post about it but everything is good 
Amazon,1ffiedhp2o29h800,1,A joke..,Packer,Working at Amazon for the time I did between 2019 and 2020 was a complete joke. We were extremely underpaid for the amount of work we did. You would get in trouble for your numbers going down due to going to the bathroom. No opportunities for advancement. 
Amazon,1ffie41e53kji001,3,Great opportunity but exacts a toll,Sr. Program Manager,"Amazon can be a great place for advancement as the culture is very focused on learning, there are many stretch opportunities, and the culture does support promotion from within. Amazon will push you to grow and develop new skills.  The downside though is long hours and high stress which can lead to burnout. There is very little in the way of work/life balance. I really appreciate Amazon's focus on doing right by the customer but find that same focus lacking when it comes to doing right by employees. "
Amazon,1ffid3a38u412802,5,Would recommend ,Fulfillment Associate,"It was amazing working there. I was in the packing department and it was really fun. I made several friends and the management was very supportive. Just don\xe2\x80\x99t mess around when they tell you that you will get in trouble for slacking or TOT (time off task), because you will. "
Amazon,1ffic6ojpo29h800,2,Mindless monkey work,FC Associate,You will work at somewhat decent pace for a long shift. You will most likely zone out. There is little to actually think about. Think of yourself as a human machine
Amazon,1ffi5jonvhie4801,3,"It's a warehouse, it's good, bad and ugly",Ship Dock ,"It's what you make it, I needed a more positive, motivating environment. When it became less than that, it was time to go. You go in and do your job but don't become too great and have a better relationship with the associates on the floor, the managers don't like that, well some of them. They have their picks and sadly they make it clear everyday."
Amazon,1ffi25r763kji002,5,Bring u closer to the community on a worldwide basis,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Amazon was a fantastic experience for me it paid well they were flexible but be warned human resource on warehouse grounds are terrible and of no help what so ever also the safety associates that walk around seem as they have favoritism to some and not others and are completely disrespectful when approached by set associates
Amazon,1ffhmjjv9sa1l802,3,Productive ,Packer,Fast paced. Mangers don\xe2\x80\x99t really know what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing but have really good benefits. Super long hours. Vacation is based on hours and not days so it\xe2\x80\x99s a little harder to manage 
Amazon,1ffhd8hmso29h801,3,ok place to work temporarily ,Amazon Warehouse Associate,pay is alright for what labor you have to do. Managers and PAs will leave you alone if your above the average rate for your department. A major plus is summoning time off before or during work.
Amazon,1ffhbvgaku428801,3,"Not the best, but not thebworst",Associate,"Amazon is successful inspite of itself. Some of the policies that are in place would put most other businesses in bankruptcy. The turnover ratio is astounding but predictable, due to the times we find ourselves living in now. Managers are are unseasonably and too many seem not to want to take charge of running their individual areas in the most productive way possible. Lots of favoritism going on, which inhibits a smooth flow. Shifts against shifts, instead of working together as a cohesive team. Not sure if or how you can solve these and other issues without starting all over from scratch."
Amazon,1ffhb946asa1l800,4,Great benefits,Order Picker,"The job is not hard but it's standing 10 hrs, lifting, and bending. So it's hard on the body. The benefits are great and they start on day 1 pay could be better for the amount of work. "
Amazon,1ffhaq2sh3kji002,1,Horrible managers & HR favoritism ,Fufillment Associate,This place has the worse management and will fire you for getting hurt or I\xe2\x80\x99m in pain from something at the facility. Hr will not compensate and will play games until finally firing you within a timeframe they set and mess up. 
Amazon,1ffhab1cfo29h800,1,Worst place I have every worked at,Pit Operator,"Was there for 4 1/2 years. There is complete confusion all the time. Amazon mangers set you up to fail every day. Wait until peak and then you have to work 6 ten hour shifts. If you are looking for lot of overtime and do not have a family, then maybe this is the place for you. Since I lived 20 plus miles from FC, I was gone 13 to 14 hours a day because of traffic."
Amazon,1ffha42vosa1l801,5,Fun ,Picker/Packer,"Productive face pace. Must eat , drink water, & rest .Great benefits & workout environment.Opportunities for company growth .Co-workers are motivating."
Amazon,1ffh93vuhsa1l802,4,Decent job ,Warehouse Associate,"It's an Amazon warehouse. You are on your feet 10-12 hours a day. They have different shift types and start times that are really flexible which is the best part. The pay has barely gone up in the Orlando location. It was $15 an hour in 2018, it's still $15 an hour in 2021. Pay increases depending on shift type, but if you want a slightly less physically stressful job, I recommend a lot of other employers in the area paying the same or more with better benefits (Target, Disney, Publix warehouses, and so on). You probably won't ever know who your manager is. The job can be extremely boring to some, but it's a decent job for anyone who isn't a fan of customer service and doesn't want to be social with people. It's easy to move up if you put in the work and they have different opportunities to do so, overall, it's a decent job with decent pay and the perfect job to blend in and just be a number if that's your thing. If you're looking for more stimulation or social interactions, I'd recommend elsewhere. "
Amazon,1ffh21o63u428802,3,Not a bad workplace but hard to advance,Fufillment Associate,The pay is alright but they need to be more competitive with the surrounding warehouses it makes it difficult to want to stay here and with all the people leaving for other buildings they try and put the work on the ones left. 
Amazon,1ffh1maudu428802,2,Leadership and culture shifts,Instructional Designer,"After 11 years at the company, almost all autonomy had been stripped. It might vary from team to team, but my corporate customer service team provided very little support or transparency."
Amazon,1ffh1lb6fo292802,4,Decent,Associate,"Working here is decent, pay is alright, management sucks to be honest but the coworkers are pretty cool and really good benefits as well, all depends on the warehouse you work at. "
Amazon,1ffgrm784u412801,3,It is a good starter job,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Good place to work  people there are great the time istge only bad part you spend more time there at work then you do at home all in all it is a great starter job
Amazon,1ffgr7rl0o29h802,5,Productive and fast paced ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Just do what your told to do it\xe2\x80\x99s work people we show up do a job we are trained to do and clock out rinse and repeat for the rest of the work week. Managers were awesome and good to be around. All depends on your work attitude and managers 
Amazon,1ffgookiuu412800,4,Good starter job,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"If you're looking for a decent start up job this would be it, they let pretty much anyone in (age, experience) which also inlays the fault. Most of the people that are hired on are younger college students that have no work drive or even desire to be there. Every shift I ever worked always had groups of young people standing around talking instead of doing their job for the short 4 hour shifts. If there was ever volunteer time to leave they would always be the first ones to jump on it and be the first ones to complain if we ever had to stay 5 hours, and do the most minimal work possible during the last hour. Some (not all) supervisors would spend the shift talking to other supervisors rarely about work which lead to associates being left unattended. Like I said good starter job or job to make a bit of side money but not a place to start a career."
Amazon,1ffgm7fajoc8k802,1,You’re just disposable garbage. ,Warehouse Associate,"They\xe2\x80\x99ll demand loyalty, they\xe2\x80\x99ll demand honesty, they\xe2\x80\x99ll demand a good work ethic and they will work you half to death. They\xe2\x80\x99ll manipulate the rules and treat you with all of the reverence of a stray dog. Your just part of the machine and they won\xe2\x80\x99t even treat you like a human being. "
Amazon,1ffgk9313o292802,4,Great place to learn,Software Engineer II,This is really team dependent at AmazonPros: Smart motivated co-workers that will drive you and teach you.Cons: You will need to work many hours when deadlines come around - sometimes grinding late hours to connect with team members around the globe.
Amazon,1ffgk8c7au428800,5,Good Place to work,Stower,It\xe2\x80\x99s a hit or miss with management. My supervisor is great and helpful. If you have any issues your supervisor will help. The work can be Hard but it pays off on payday.

Amazon,1ffftuk76hie4802,1,"Easy work and constant hours, but bad management and process assistants",Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"I came there to work nothing more nothing less, I exceeded my rates and learned everything fast and that was my biggest mistake. The PA\xe2\x80\x99s ended up using me for the more intensive manual labor tasks that no one wanted to do and some of those tasks were the PA\xe2\x80\x99s own problems to deal with. I would bust my butt while people getting the same pay would sit down and talk and relax most of the day it felt similar to communism if you ask me. Oh and managers do not do anything but show up when they have a problem with the worker because the computer tells them to,  they are no help for any questions not even HR. Communication within the building is a joke. Luckily for me this was just a job to pay bills while I was attending school but I gave it my all because that\xe2\x80\x99s how I was raised regardless of the negative and lazy coworkers and horrible management that do nothing but look at a laptop and the lazy PA\xe2\x80\x99s that climbed the ladder to lose their hard work ethic because they can. Managers and PA\xe2\x80\x99s should be the most hard working people out of the whole building to be able to lead workers if they can\xe2\x80\x99t do that , how do you expect to lead your workers?

Best management ever atleast in my building. As it gose ""ask a fish to climb a tree and it will live a lifetime believing its stupid""...in my building haven\'t felt like a fish out of water even once!

I was trained on the forklift and the walker my first 5 months using it to pick customer orders instead of being on foot like a lot of people. After that I got promoted to a position on the Tom Team after me being an employee 6 months and was sent to school to get my CDL license driving their trucks on an as needed basis from building to building or on the yard pulling trailers to and from the dock door.

I managed to switch to a position that would not require me to do much physical labor but even then I am left with no leadership support and burned out from being assigned workload that should be a two person job. They won't care for you as person, you are just a number to them. If you have a degree you might score a comfortable job at Amazon but otherwise you'll just have to kiss up to get a higher position. "

Amazon,1ff948mnau33u802,5,Productive and fun place to work,Warehouse Package Sorter,A fast paced challenging fun place to work. Frequent opportunities for extra time.  Think of it as getting paid to exercise. There are opportunities to train for other positions there if you inquire about them.
Amazon,1ff90d060308t000,2,Amazon is the Walmart of the delivery biz,Driver,"Amazon will overwork you to the grown. 200 stops in a day is ridiculous.. and the work schedule constantly changes from mornings to noons and there\xe2\x80\x99s really nothing you can do about it. They also close operations down on most Holidays which is nice but they don\xe2\x80\x99t pay you for it, thats crazy to me.. But if you like working on your own and don\xe2\x80\x99t mind driving this may be for you because the pay is pretty decent but say good bye to family life because weekends and evenings are basically mandatory "
Amazon,1ff8svhpu308t001,1,Amazon Is Just Horrible,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"It feels really dehumanizing that ""The Amazon Labor Model"" of basically having human robots that you work until they break is an open secret and find it absolutely disgusting. I personally experienced this at my work place and was met with little caring from my supervisors and manager. I tested out working here and it was everything the horror stories told me. If this is the future of working in America, we\'re going to have a lot of labor refugees fleeing for their lives."
Amazon,1ff8s6naru3a4802,1,Awful ,Receiver,Terrible. Boring no respect managers are weirdos it\xe2\x80\x99s almost like they want you to quit. They\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you in the chiller for the entire shift if they had their way beware 
Amazon,1ff8oeebvt4ep800,5,Easy job for the money ,Warehouse Associate,Amazon was a very easy job meaning the work was very simple and easy. The only con of the job is a lot of walking for 10 hours a days. The lag is great. Benefits are great as well .
Amazon,1ff8e7m5ro221801,3,Nice place to work at first.,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"Let me start off my saying: When this fulfillment center first opened, it was nice; and to some degrees, it\'s still nice. The pay is good, the benefits are really amazing, and you can use your vacation and PTO easily.The overall culture suffer though; first and foremost: if you aren\'t kissing up, Supervisors aren\'t doing anything for you. Got into 2 separate altercations and Supervisors did nothing-and that\'s when they\'re actually around; it wasn\'t until HR tells me: Supervisors won\'t do anything, go to HR. Even then, HR doesn\'t do anything when ""investigating further"".Second is their write-up system: Once you get a write up, you have 30 days where you cannot move to any other position in the warehouse, and you can get them as easily as not packing fast enough, leading to a never-ending circle if you can\'t pack fast enough.Honestly, this could be such an amazing place to work, and I used to tell people so; but they dropped the ball and stopped caring. HR had one person who cared enough right at the end and actually put in work, but it was too late. So if you can keep your head down, you\'re fine. If you see what\'s really going on, this won\'t be the place for you."
Amazon,1ff8ae6d5u3a4801,3,Good pay,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Nothing much to say about the place the work is work  you get paid fairly and they have incentives for the people who actually show up and work. A lot of kids work there
Amazon,1ff888a63u33u802,4,Great pay ,Package Handler/Sorter,Pay was great. Time off was easy to get since everything is done on the employee app. Requesting pto of sick time and vacation days were easy and always approved. Only bad was the stress to make impossible numbers. Most off us peed in bottles so we can make the quota. The bathrooms were at minimum  a 20 minute ordeal 15 minutes minimum was just walking to and from  the bathroom . You could be fired by a AI computer no human even Looks at it. 
Amazon,1ff7v5ev7u3a4802,5,Productive fun place to work,Vendor Associate,For those who say Amazon is a horrible place to work are out of their minds i used all my time and they still worked with me my wife became ill and they fixed my schedule so i can be by her side and still be able to work. You get holiday pay even if you are not working that day Amazon is Amazing I'm proud to be an Amazonian!!!
Amazon,1ff7ul03ou3a4800,3,Lots of pay and overtime poor work culture,Sr. Human Resources Assistant,Worked in HR at Amazon for less than a year. Lots to learn and you will bond with your coworkers. Lots of overtime opportunities however poor work/life balance. Poor management and culture.

Amazon,1ff7qm9rro221802,3,Unorganized,Delivery Driver,"Good pay, long days, unorganized. Contract drivers get more routes than company drivers. a lot of sitting around.

Amazon,1ff77u9uiu3a4802,1,Not what the job description says,L4 Area Manager,"Not what the job description says, underpaid and hours make it impossible to have any type of life outside of work. Benefits make it hard to quit. I was told four 10 hour shifts, walked into four 12 hour shifts at a minimum. I was expecting increase at peak but not an extra 32 hours a month on a regular basis. That would have seriously affected me accepting the offer. They also dont tell you your shift until you accepted and went through training and that is not right. Also dont get to comfortable in your shift because they change often! Everyone will work nights and days."
Amazon,1ff76e7rdo221802,1,eh,Stocker,"not great, bad work life balance, didn't like it very much but would recommend if you need a job asap good managers and coworkers and nice benefits but overall eh"

Promotion after Promotion in front of your face constantly but yet no matter how hard you work or how much butt you kiss to no avail. If your a pretty girl you'll be fine.

Amazon,1ff6sgomhu33u802,3,Productive and fun,Stower,Not bad. You get out what you put in.Opportunities for advancement.  Good be if it\xe2\x80\x99s and PTO. It\xe2\x80\x99s a warehouse job so expect to work. You do have productivity standards you need to meet daily. 
Amazon,1ff6p63kdt4pl802,3,Alright for part time,Warehouse Associate,Ok job for students or people looking for a 2nd job or part time position.Flexible schedule with different shifts 24/7. Different positions and departments.
Amazon,1ff6n1bj2308t002,4,Pretty cool ,Warehouse Worker,Definitely not the sweat shop people think it is. It\xe2\x80\x99s a warehouse and not a desk job so be prepared to feel sore and stand on your feet for 10 hours a day.
Amazon,1ff6lp0go308t002,4,Good experience! ,Human Resources Specialist II - DLS Case Assistant,I was contracted to work with Amazon and it was a good opportunity to work with such a large corporation. Unfortunately there was no option for FT once my contract was over. I worked on the disability and leave services team and had a very minimal scope and my team was not given a chance for more responsibility. Only downfall.

Amazon,1ff6horovo221800,3,"Good: Great benefits, overtime available (up to 60 hours) Bad: The HR department is inept and will cause you a serious headache.  ",Packer,"The turnover rate is crazy. They hire anyone with a heart beat and the HR department never ceases to make incessant mistakes. I have had 4 managers in the past year. The management will be on you if you're not working the entire time and/or if you're not working fast enough (making rate). You'll be very tired after your shifts. Take advantage of all benefits - they're great! I obtained this job with the hopes of Amazon helping with my tuition; however, this was highly misleading. There are very miniscule opportunities for tuition assistance. They'll help with less than 10 job careers. For instance, they'll help you become a welder, a driver, a nurse, paralegal etc. "
Amazon,1ff6g9bs2308t000,4,A lot of room for growth,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,A lot of opportunities for growth throughout the company. Co-workers are definitely the best part of working for Amazon. Management rotated throughout departments too frequent to become proficient/competent at postions.

Amazon,1ff64ehdvt4ep802,2,Strict and Unfair,Warehouse Associate,"I work in the stowing department so this is just a review of stowing. The Stone Mountain, Georgia location has a lot of biases and bad management in the stowing department. The managers have favorites they promote and don't discipline but will get onto others for much less. You are not allowed headphones at all (understandable) but you're also not allowed to talk while at your stations; however, there are many who break these rules and don't receive any feedback, but there are others that do, so the discipline is unfair and biased toward the ones the managers like. You're also only allowed two thirty minute breaks out of a ten and a half hour day, unless the managers are giving out extra minutes as an incentive to push higher rates. "
Amazon,1ff62t4q0u33u802,2,Hard on the Body,Warehouse Associate,"You're extremely tired after the week is over that you can barely do anything on your days off, not to mention the mandatory overtime that you have to do. It's hard on the body, fast-paced and the expectations are super high."

Amazon,1ff5nktdvu3a4801,3,Simple job easy work,Picker/Packer,Very simple job to work the management was ok at times. It\xe2\x80\x99s independent work and you rarely have to check in with management. You can schedule as many shifts and you want if you are a flex seasonal employee. But you can get converted over full time if you want to.

Amazon,1ff5l15o0t4ep802,2,"""Flex"" Reduced Time; Nothing Flexible About It",Returns Processor,"Am currently a Flex Reduced Time (Flex RT) employee. That means I don't need to work full time (40+hrs a week). However, there is a MINIMUM of 120 hours I need to work every month. That's not TOO bad, but the issues arise when you use the employee A to Z app to pick shifts. Yes, you can pick shifts, but don't get excited because there's almost no shifts to pick from. It's first come, first served, and you get no notification when shifts are posted in the app. You're then stuck picking 7p-11:45p shifts and 12am-5:45am shifts. Not only that but these shifts aren't long enough. No more than 5.75 hours at a time. 120 hours a month wouldn't be so bad if you could pick better shifts, and if the shifts were longer. You're essentially forced to work 10-11 hour days by working 2 short shifts with a short 45min-1hr break between. That's the ONLY WAY to get hours, and meet your monthly hour quota. I'm sorry, but is it so hard to understand that I want to be able to pick when I work, while still having at least a minimum of a 6 hour shift?Then you can't work more than 6 days in a row, and if you only do 7pm-11:45pm 6 days in a row that still doesn't even add up to 30hrs a week. I shouldn't have to work 10-11 hours a day, nor should working 6 days in a row be so futile.Will be looking for better opportunities with actual flexibility soon; I'm just using them for the $1000 sign-on bonus. That's probably what most people do, otherwise they wouldn't be hiring all the time."
Amazon,1ff5kfjedo221802,3,Delivery job,Delivery Driver,"Working with Amazon had its up and mostly downs, but still I do admit I had the most fun time working there, to clarify I got hired directly from Amazon as seasonal, and it was delivering packages around the California Valley. It first started out great, Amazon was paying thier employees alot more then fedex, ups, etc. At the time. They even had great benefits, but it was limited to the seasonal employees. Nonetheless the job task in hand was very simple, drive a van and deliver the packages in a fast save matter. You were always on your own, at times you would get a helper, but that was soo rarely. In the summer time you would receive free ice cream when you finished your route. Many cool people to meet, and one awesome leadership that worked there. Sadly management is terrible, when it comes down to moving up in Amazon. In fact everyone that worked with Amazon that was seasonal got a write up for the most dumbest ways possible, in all honesty it was a miscommunication because they never told us what rules were added or taken out, thus getting write ups for everyone. Overall I loved working there, in fact I would have devoted my career for Amazon. But because the management, and firing all seasonal employees (because we were about to reach the 1 year mark, and gave all the jobs to the contractors) they saw us as useless...so that's how I experienced the all mighty powerful Amazon, no I didn't work at the warehouse, so I heard alot of bad things for them. But yea.."

They claim to offer full time, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a secret that only managers can even get that. So any actual normal employee can\xe2\x80\x99t get full time, only management. Some managers can be nice and appreciative, but most disrespect us or just don\xe2\x80\x99t value us at all. They treat us ALL like we\xe2\x80\x99re lazy children, instead of only treating those who deserve it like that. They don\xe2\x80\x99t even care because they get paid a lot to walk around and point their finger, so they don\xe2\x80\x99t waste their time recognizing good work. They just walk up and make a comment and move on, before they sit down for an hour. After 6 months of working as hard as I can, only to be treated equally with the worst employees, I now do not push myself anymore as I see there is no reward for it. You only leave with an aching back, meanwhile the guy next to you is on his phone all day and still making every penny that you make, with no threat of being fired. So unfortunately, you are the fool if you give them your all, because they don\xe2\x80\x99t care. You\xe2\x80\x99re best off taking it easy and being average at your job, because they expect that and they will not honor you. "

My hands, legs and feet would be sore almost everyday. If you work the full time shift good luck, this will be your life. If you work the part time it\xe2\x80\x99ll be pretty easy. Management is okay, make friends with one. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be easy to move up that way and get put into better roles. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t care about that, then it\xe2\x80\x99ll be easy to just go in do your job and leave. They say no headphones, but I worked there 2+ years and I wore them everyday. "

Amazon,1ff5dhtbcu33u802,1,Amazon is going from bad to worst,Picker,"I worked at Amazon in 2015 and though it was a stressful place to work at, the leaders made everyone feel like a team. HR worked hard to make sure you enjoyed your position even though the work was a lot. Fast forward to 2021, and this company is the worst company I've ever worked for. The leaders spend most of the day yelling at you for every little thing. I got yelled at for standing and trying to clock in on my phone. The pay is terrible for the work you do and for how you are treated. You can't listen to music which is so stupid. They also expect you to figure out the website without training, work at a high rate with a mask on and social distance while working in working in the pods. "
Amazon,1ff4ujunhu33u802,3,Watch out for Management,Warehouse Fulfillment Associate,"There are people who play the game better than others, I get it. Your boss is likely to be one of these fresh out of undergraduate school type characters. No respect for tried and true experience. Micro manage and supervise you down to the last hour until you clock out."
Amazon,1ff4l99kn308t000,2,Alright ,Associate,No benefits and everything is about a number you get pushed to work according to how much management wants to put out for the day. Flexibility is and overtime is nice 
Amazon,1ff4ge16ct4ep800,2,High expectations and bad schedules ,Associate,The pay and benefits are good but the expectations of employees are too high and too much micromanagement. They pile too much work on you and it's very easy to get in trouble.
Amazon,1ff4elmeru33u800,2,trash,Amazon Warehouse Associate,hated it they worked you like a dog with no recognition and the managers suck and the hr are mean and only care about them selves  and a far far far drive
Amazon,1ff4am8j0308t002,1,Not a good place to work at all.,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,There was really nothing I enjoyed about working here.  I worked extremely hard and was in pain daily.   You will work 4 - 10 hour shifts and lots of overtime.  You will be timed.  They do not care about their employees at all.  I have severe degenerative joint disc disease in my back and they did nothing to accommodate me.  They only care about their bottom line.  In the group of people hired at the same time as me which was about 12 of us there were only 4 of us left after about 3 months.  The work is extremely tedious.  The management is horrible and they are never around when you need them.  They will work you to the bone and even if you are doing your best they will probably let you go.  The only thing that was good was the healthcare and that\xe2\x80\x99s good because you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna need it.
Amazon,1ff4akvivt4e2802,3,If you like to work you will be fine,Warehouse Associate,shorter shifts now. Hard on your body but you become accustom to it. Managers are getting better with helping and communicating with staff. Still a lot of favoritism going on.
Amazon,1ff4aiuf9u33u800,5,Very fast paced from star of shift till the end ,Warehouse Worker,"Management is awesome. Issues are resolved quickly. Management is very respectful,friendly and genuinely concerned about you. The only down side for me are the hours. I like the fact that I\xe2\x80\x99m off at noon but I either go to bed and sleep most of the day or I go to bed at 6/7pm"
Amazon,1ff49u61uu33u802,2,Stay away from stow,Stow Associate,"Stow is probably the worst position to have in the company. I\xe2\x80\x99ve not been there long but I can tell you they will push you to hit their numbers and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t you get coached but unlike other places I\xe2\x80\x99ve been they do not account for time moving around the warehouse, finding space when they\xe2\x80\x99re at a 98% capacity, moving out of the way for pickers or stuck behind someone waiting to leave an aisle. Very little training in terms of the job itself. "
Amazon,1ff478nmpt4ep800,1,Bad security,Ljxl,Management puts you in danger and never gives lunch breaks on an 11 hour shift and treats you unfair if your not there personal buddy This has been the worst work environment ever 
Amazon,1ff45tg16u33u800,5,Okay,Amazon Warehouse Associate,Great company to work for covid really messed it up for me I  ould work there again because hours were exactly what I needed made friends and work was pretty easy. Pay was nice also 
Amazon,1ff42lc8cu3a4802,1,False hope,Warehouse Associate,Not a good job. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t like you they stick you on pick and won\xe2\x80\x99t let you transfer. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t waste your time working here keep moving to something better instead of wasting time. 
Amazon,1ff41ame3t4ep800,3,"Good pay, but for a reason. Nice spot to land if you are eager to advance.",Amazon Associate,"Associates are well paid, so management doesn't have to recognize them as actual people. Generous attendance policy, but be prepared to work. Management is so busy trying to get ahead, they don't pay attention to what you do day in and day out."
Amazon,1ff40lgoju33u802,3,Ok place to work.  Nothing amazing.,Learning Ambassador,Lots of hours on your feet.  Management not really communictating with employees.  Good people to work with.  Mandatory overtime dropped on the last minute.  Best way to move up is to be favored by management.  Hardest part of the job is being micromanaged by your work rate.  
Amazon,1ff3srhpqt4ep802,3,Work hard and go home.,Process Assistant,"Amazon is a good place to work. I don't like how managers get moved. Once you have a good team, it seams like someone is getting moved to another shift from that team. "
Amazon,1ff3re397u33u802,4,Pretty good place to work,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"It's is a very face paced environment. The work itself is very easy. They are very strict on time and do not accept doctor's notes for time off. Management is generally very friendly. Co workers are very friendly as well, though it can be a little clique-ish "
Amazon,1ff3qvk31u33u802,4,It’s okay ,Team Member,"It\xe2\x80\x99s an okay job. My biggest frustration was having to stand all day. In addition, managers don\xe2\x80\x99t really give any extra training on the job & expect you to know stuff. "
Amazon,1ff3on2d0u3a4801,4,Good work from home,Customer Service Representative,"It was a great work from home job pay could be better, being able to work from home was good because I was able to work around their schedule. I am proud customer of Amazon."
Amazon,1ff3ngdj3u3a4801,3,Ok place to get paid,Warehouse Worker,"long hours and short breaks, always tired. they run you around ragged but I feel like it is a nice pay for people just starting out.  I would not go back"
Amazon,1ff3jbl7cu3a4800,1,None,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,None  at all for sure and the ti fund . It was ok but not for me . I left and will never return. Pretty long weekend not enough breaks and to much mandatory time it was a complete hassle .
Amazon,1ff3ibr1qt4e2802,3,Time off system sucks,Problem Solver,"The job itself isn\xe2\x80\x99t terrible, its the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re literally just treated like number. If you need a day off and you dont have enough UPT/PTO or vacation hours, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing you can do. They dont accept doctors notes "
Amazon,1ff3cofu3t4e2802,1,Work,Stower/Picker,Hard work for small pay they will have you walking all around the building timing you for every little thing you barely can use the bathroom and the managers do the bare minimum 
Amazon,1ff34f1kau33u800,1,Amazon Environment ,Customer Service Representative,Amazon has amazing P. R. during training. You really think and feel you'll be everything that's said and told to you. Don't believe the sugarcoating. Actual everyday on the job is totally different. I like a job were I work and keep busy and that's one think I liked about Amazon. But don't like environment were an employee gets penalized and treated subhuman cause of their disability. They might treat other disabilities well but not all and all employees should be treated well and as human beings. Pay should be increased cause it's higher if employed via temp. agency and that $16+ should be standard if hired thru Amazon.  Amazon also needs to have more regard for employees and get rid of timers cause going to bathroom is part of life. Should be more concerned about handwashing cause some employees don't probably cause of timers and nasty hands put others at risk. Amazon could be good place for all employees if p.r. was actually applied to real workday and would help with employee retention. 
Amazon,1ff32i3ost4ep801,1,Worst job ever,Grunt worker,"Worst job I've ever had, no bathroom breaks, no job security, the equipment was always damaged and we would always be blamed for it, one time I ate something from the breakroom and got sick and they didn't let me leave. Most of the time the scanners malfunctioned and gave you the wrong aisle or sometimes even the wrong order altogether which we would be blamed for and if too many orders are done wrong doesn't matter if it hasn't your fault they just fire you with no warning, I came in and my badge didn't let me into the building, it was the security guard that told me that the reason my badge didn't work was because i had been terminated, i didn't get an email, call or even a text"
Amazon,1ff30r82ju3a4800,3,Warehouse work,Warehouse Associate,"If you have worked in a warehouse then you know exactly what you're getting into. I worked at phl 4 in Carlisle, typical warehouse environment. If you happen to have a great operation manager then everything is golden. They check on you if rates aren't up to what they expect and try to figure out how to get you there. If you don't have a great operations manager then it is a controlled chaos. Advancement is really about who likes you unfortunately. I had coworkers that were the best at what they do and they were passed on promotions. Those promotions usually went to the employee that kissed the managers butts the best."
Amazon,1ff2vkqu9u33u801,5,Work the right way,Logistics Support Specialist,Amazon is a company that has articulated excellent leadership principles and lives up to them to the best of their ability everyday. My personal experience has been very positive as I received a raise as well as a promotion within 60 days to a job more suited to my skills. My manager helped me in every step of the process to acquire this position
Amazon,1ff2if6rpu3a4801,3,Great place to work,Sortation Associate/ Delivery Associate Warehouse ,"This Is a great place to work.You get paid every weekManagement can be betterFast paced environment The company tracks your productivity The hrs can be more flexible, but recommend if you can commit to the schedule They have morning and overnight shift; shift diff if you choose overnight and or have Saturday and Sunday included in your schedule.They offer overtime pay and holiday(time and a half)They offer incentives to employees through raffles and stowe ratesEmployee Discount"
Amazon,1ff2fki5qu33u800,3,I was just a personal shopper,Customer Service Representative,It is fine to make extra cash not a full time gig but if this is what you are looking for it is fine. It is hard to get shifts because you have to be on a app at a certain time every day waiting for shifts to drop and compete with 100 other people trying to login at the same time and get shifts
Amazon,1ff283qgkt4e2800,3,Good place if you wanna stack up on cash but very draining,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"Everything everyone says about Amazon is true. Management will constantly be on you about your numbers and monitor you 24/7. You will be expected to work in every department,you could be on the last hour of your shift and they could still possibly pull you to work in a completely different department. It\xe2\x80\x99s probably not much different than any other warehouse job though.Some people do perfectly fine in this environment and you do have alot of opportunities to make money. The job would be improved if they at least allowed headphone use. You\xe2\x80\x99re standing for the whole shift and monitored, so allowing people to listen to music would keep people up for their 10+ hr shift and encourage movement. Also, the mandatory overtime is unnecessary, most staff would willingly sign up for overtime so to require it for everyone seems redundant. "
Amazon,1ff1s3lv2u3a4801,3,ok,Customer Service Representative,it was ok working there they are good to their employees but aren't very supportive. and pay could be a lot better but otherwise pretty good. very clean 
Amazon,1ff1otaoau3a4802,1,Work like a dog,Package Handler,"Awful environment. Too many cliques, managers don't appreciate employees at all, too overwhelming when it gets busy. You're just another body.. tiring"
Amazon,1ff1jn49gu33u800,1,Very hard work and long hours,Outbound Associate,I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what I was getting into. Benefits is the only good thing this company has. People there do work like robots and very often employees get hurt. I got to work in the front where once a week I see people get taken out in a wheelchair or even in a stretcher by the ambulance. Amazon has been nothing but a nightmare for me even though I\xe2\x80\x99m quiting in good terms. I just hope that someday Jeff goes back into space in a one way ticket
Amazon,1ff1hokagu3a4801,5,Pleasant,Seasonal Virtual Customer Service Representative,"I worked as a Seasonal Remote Customer Care Specialist for Amazon. I can honestly say I didn't hate it. The customers were some of the happiest customers I have ever dealt with. Everyone adores Amazon, so working there makes you feel like a super hero. Very fast paced , back to back calls so you gotta like to stay busy ."
Amazon,1ff1egesto221800,1,The only thing good about this job is the pay.,Amazon Warehouse Associate,The instructions on what you had to do was easy. You would have to be willing to be on your feet and care heavy packages for 10+ hours a day to enjoy this job. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t care about having friendships within the environment this is the job because you have no time to mingle. Comfortable shoes are a must.
Amazon,1ff1deipm308t002,3,It’s okay,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"It\xe2\x80\x99s okay if you have people to talk to for the 10+ hours. Management is laid back in certain departments. They won\xe2\x80\x99t care if you have a medical condition that limits your ability to work, wherever they put you you better get used to it."
Amazon,1ff1ctua1t4ep801,4,Great people to work with..,Inventory Clerk,"Decent pay, lots of hours, gifts galore, but definitely had problems with management. I enjoyed the people I worked with the most honestly, it was very hot in the warehouse but plenty of water tanks to fill up on. "
Amazon,1ff16l2p4t4e2801,3,"Work is fast paced, lots of bending and stretching. Coworkers make the job enjoyable. ",Stower,"I worked as a stower 95% of the time. Very fast paced, company tracks how fast and accurate you are. I worked there a year and a half. During PEAK holiday time the pace and expectations really pick up. Only fans in the warehouse environment so summers can be quite uncomfortable. Was good as a part time gig (worked 3 days a week evening shift) to earn extra income."
Amazon,1ff0uvgbto221800,4,A safety net place to work,Process Guide,I had just moved to AZ and they hired me within 2 days. I personally wouldn't make a career out of working there. You will be taken advantage of if they see you are a hard worker and a good worker. They will give you more titles and responsibilities but won't pay you extra.
Amazon,1ff0tdaccu3a4802,2,Run while you still can ,Amazon Warehouse Associate,I was working there for at least two months and I never seen nor knew who my manager was. They don't really get to know you or find time to. You get put on a station and expected to stand for hours with short breaks between every 2 hours or so.
Amazon,1ff0prvhvu3a4800,3,No family life,Production Assistant,If your good your manager will keep you back to benefit themselves for bonus. If you suck but your manager  likes you its easier  for  advancements wich comes with better pay
Amazon,1ff0odraqu3a4801,3,Average company ,Fullfillment Associate,Average company decent compensation. Leave and time off are ok. Some discount programs a 100 Amazon voucher or discount. Work shoes program available on paper after a year professional development options
Amazon,1ff0nlq0st4e2801,3,Typical warehouse job,Fulfillment Associate,It\xe2\x80\x99s a typical warehouse Job. Cold in the winter hot in the summer. Hardly any advancement opportunities. Management always clueless never knew where people were suppose to be or what job to do. 
Amazon,1ff0n6opit4ep800,3,Productive ,Stower,It may be very productive at times but since it is a fairly new building we often are slow as well but peak season is arriving and the money and hours will definitely be fun 
Amazon,1ff0n3m9au33u801,4,Consistent work,Yard Marshal,It's a great place to work.  Very structured management could be better.  It's a difficult but fulfilling job.  I enjoyed my time here I would recommend the warehouse
Amazon,1ff0ir9d2u33u802,3,Megashift=Megastruggles,Sortation Associate,"I secured a first shift position, and maintained that scheduled no problem. They removed all first shift for sortation and now only Megashift remains. It is very hard to balance family life, when you have to report to work at 2am and get off at 1pm in the afternoon. No daycares are open at 2am. "
Amazon,1ff0i6amjt4ep800,3,Very disorganized,Area Manager Intern,I felt like the company was very disorganized despite being a multi billion dollar company. Work culture was also quite cliquey and it felt less about working together. 
Amazon,1ff0hmpttu33u800,3,Boring but easy work ,Fulfillment Associate,long hours make it really tiring in a sense but besides that the return warehouse in which i worked was very easy and simple work with a lot of freedom in scheduling.
Amazon,1ff0h20liu33u800,3,Management is bad,Warehouse Associate,"Decent money, management is horrible, would never recommend anyone to work for amazon unless you need money. No Career opportunity. Long hours of doing nothing "
Amazon,1ff0fpmlbu3a4802,3,It’s okay,Forklift Operator,I work there for 2 years it was an okay place to work. It has its ups and downs like they took all the extra bonus away to higher the wages but if you do the math the extra bonus was more than the higher wages.
Amazon,1ff0fhvc0u3a4800,3,Physically draining,Warehouse Associate,"Amazon isn't a bad place to work if you are fresh out of high school and don't have kids. The job is physically demanding and although you get 3 days off, you won't want to do anything on those days! My building was nice to work at. No drama and friendly people. "
Amazon,1ff0fbvavt4e2801,5,Great place to work. ,MKC4 Associate (L1 – L3),"Easily grow your career, great place to work up all work is recognized. Always room for growth, everyone was friendly. Opportunities for travel and seeing other places. "
Amazon,1ff0dvu26u33u800,1,Nothing ,Warehouse Worker,Nothing place is horrible and a joke \xe2\x80\xa6Please find another job then Amazon you will honestly thank me that you did Management is terrible and you are over worked with little to no breaks in between 
Amazon,1fevp43veu3a4802,3,Work load,Amazon Warehouse Associate,Be ready to work expectations are high not enough appreciation for the people who actually work and the ones that come to work stand around and talk to much get away cheating and cherry picking the easy work.
Amazon,1fevknmn0t4ep800,4,Ok if you need to get hired quick,Fulfillment Center Associate,Its Ok they are just very strict especially when it comes to safety and attendance the turnover is very high they will drop you in an instant. But its good if you need to start work immediately. 
Amazon,1feverjurt4e2802,3,Easy labor,Warehouse Associate,Quick start and pretty easy labor especially for what I was being paid. I enjoyed the different shift options that they have. One being able to work only 3 days a week.
Amazon,1feveq9n9u33u801,1,Hated it,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"Amazon sucks. Terrible management and they don\xe2\x80\x99t even care about their employees. Short breaks. They just really push you for numbers, and don\xe2\x80\x99t care if you\xe2\x80\x99re burnt out."
Amazon,1fev8uemro221802,5,WHS specialist,WHS specialist,Working at Amazon At the fulfillment centers is definitely not a bad place to work. I like how they take health and safety seriously. They really do look out for their employees.
Amazon,1fev8pc60308t002,4,FC is rough,FC Associate I,"Limited advancement, extremely repetitive work. Pay is ok. Not a worthwhile long term place for employment unless you intend to and /manage to move up beyond a level 1/tier 1 associate."
Amazon,1fev71tkgu3a4802,4,Wasn't bad ,Vendor Recieve,My Amazon was newer and even though it was opened around peak season there were some days that we didn't have much work so there was plenty of vto. Overall I liked working there met some great people who I still stay in contact with and would probably work there again.
Amazon,1fev6iouft4e2801,4,Productive and great learning benefits ,Warehouse Operator,Good place to work depending on your department. Benefits are great and the work environment is cool . The half a hour lunches suck a little but you only have to clock out for the first one.
Amazon,1fev5uehdu3a4802,4,"Hard physical work in the sort centers, but many different positions to try ",Sort Associate,"I have enjoyed working for Amazon in a sort center.  I like it when the managers know you, and your name and encourage you to strive.  Some management changes and some treat you like a number, which is not fun or motivating."
Amazon,1fev4gc7au33u800,2,Just another cog in  the machine...corporate benefits are nice though!. ,Picker,"Repetitive work,  management randomly picks people to advance to better roles without explanation. Alot of favoritism and honestly a toxic vibe all around.  picking could be fun but it was never actually fun because of clogged aisles / poor planning etc."
Amazon,1fev0qfrhu3a4802,2,Benefits & Pay,Picker/Packer/Stower,Benefits are great & pay as well but overall you will not like working at Amazon eventually. You\xe2\x80\x99re literally a robot. You can meet some fun people and cool managers or they can be the complete opposite. 
Amazon,1fev0lm9lt4e2800,1,associate,Associate,worked for better companies youre only a production number. they try to make you feel like a team until you make a mistake and have a supervisor come to your station and ask you so what happened with said items. micro managed and constantly watched for tot time just using the restroom which ware not relatively close to your work stations
Amazon,1fev0ksjjt4ep800,3,It was okay,Amazon Fresh Associate,"Barely had any training from the managers when I first started. I had to learn how to do my job from other employees who worked there. Some of the staff had no idea what they were doing. The managers rely on experienced pickers to train new employees. Cooperate never really explains the reasonings behind their changes. The managers I had later on were very chill and supported me. Overall, my experience was alright."
Amazon,1feulq9q0u33u800,5,Repetitive job,Picker/Packer,"Job was extremely repetitive,hard on your feet. No sense of belonging, weekly pay , good benefits, pretty easy job but a lot of walking physical moving "
Amazon,1feuam7e2o221801,3,Not the best and not the worst ,Process Assistant (Supervisor),"Honestly it boils down to if you would rather prefer doing physical labor or mental labor. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a normal associate, you\xe2\x80\x99ll of course wonder what (most) higher ups are doing all day long on their laptop. Although it may look like they\xe2\x80\x99re relaxed, there\xe2\x80\x99s a ton of data driven info that\xe2\x80\x99s getting recycled into constant status updates (is the easiest way to describe it). It then leads to adjustments of associates, and how to improve performance. This job is absolutely draining once you stop being a regular associate, but surely good for later experience. Ride the wave and take what you can use and then move on. "
Amazon,1feua6jfjo221802,1,Do not even think of joining this company,Area Manager,Do not join this company especially in the operations and FC field. They work you to death and pay peanuts for it. No work life balance whatsoever. Avoid at all costs. 
Amazon,1feu8tfb9u3a4801,1,Horrible culture ,Stowing Associate,"Under paid, under staffed, under appreciated. Mandatory overtime ALL the time = No work life balance. Everyone gets paid the same regardless of effort."
Amazon,1feu7fiqqt4e2800,4,"It’s a good job, just takes a big mental toll at times.",Warehouse Associate,"Working for amazing has been really great at times. Then there are time where you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to feel. Most managers truly try their best, and then there\xe2\x80\x99s time where it feels like your not valid. But doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that happen at most jobs? I unfortunately just have a lot of stuff going on in my life and feel as if Amazon and I are not on the eye level. I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have anything good nor really bad to say.  Also would like to point out I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to several different warehouses and all of them are different. No two warehouses are the same."
Amazon,1feu5721rt4e2800,1,Horrible workplace,wearhouse worker,In my time working for Amazon the only two good things that came out of it was the pay and benefits. Everything else was horrible the hours the amount of labor and the fact that the company and HR don\xe2\x80\x99t really care about what happens inside the wearhouse I wish everyone could see the working conditions and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the company would go under. 
Amazon,1feu4068f308t000,2,Great Benefits,Fulfillment Associate,Poor management.  HR keep on recruiting and we always end up of incompetent managers.  No mission and vission.  Poor company culture and values.  Great for start up finding a job and thise want to increase per hour pay.  
Amazon,1feu2jq10t4ep802,3,Great if you dont mind sucking up for advancement,Pack Process Assistant,"If you get offered to PG on a pack side, dont do it. The worst experience I think available there. You are doing 70% of a PA's work with no extra pay and little recognition. IF you do PG? Try to talk to your managers about moving into PA. You will get a pay raise and be doing essentially the same thing you were doing. PG is the time to learn everything you can. Definitely talk to the person doing to board to get a good footing and prove that you are good at your job though. Then from there look for movement."
Amazon,1feu1f8l0t4e2801,3,Easygoing ,Picker/Packer,This job is pretty easy the manager lacks communication you barely talk to anyone at this job. They need more supplies for employees. Sometime you wait 2-3 hours for a scanner.
Amazon,1fetn5dknu33u801,3,My feet hurt,Warehouse Picker/Packer,"My whole body hurts. Free work shoes though. Alright pay but not for strain placed on body. Everything is an assembly line including the employees. PTO and Vacation time. Overall the job is okay. Wasnt well informed of things like TOT etc...You are in so much pain that by the end of the day, you are second guessing coming back for your next shift. "
Amazon,1fetlqgo1308t002,1,Awful company ,"ICQA, Outbound Picker","You get penalized for everything and while you try to move up, management makes it extremely difficult for you to proceed in positions you want to get into. Also you rarely get any days off for anything."
Amazon,1fetl5gjhu3a4800,5,"Amazon great pay, but you will really work for it",Sortation Specialist,"Not for slackers or lazy people. Amazon is go go go enviornment. Must be careful carts are heavy, packages are not light. Average amount of weight to move during one shift is 700 lbs if you add all packages weight together. Some great employees and management teams. Don't get hurt. Workers comp is a foreign language at Amazon. Even if it's not your fault, gotta wear steel toe shoes. (Amazon will pay for a pair for you) boxes fall, stuff breaks. I once saw a broken cast iron skillet and I wondered how in that happened? "
Amazon,1fetbdkafu33u802,3,Good for temporarily or permanent ,General Labor Work/ Packing,"Temporary or permanent position available. Stand whole shift, very hot environment, people to close to each other. The management could do better. Your a regular worker. All the want to do is get the orders out. Very repetitive and standing long hours isn't desirable."
Amazon,1fesc0j05t4e2800,4,Great People but Hard Work,Fulfillment Associate,It\xe2\x80\x99s a warehouse so it is of course going to be hard work. Unfortunately it was a lot on my body but I made some great friendships out of it. Not the type of job you want to retire from.
Amazon,1fes2t0rh308t001,5,Great for part time,Central Operations Specialist,"I really liked it here, I feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s a great job for students or part time workers. Probably the best job culture I have been in. I would highly recommend."
Amazon,1fes2lfdsu3a4801,1,Under paid and overworked. ,Delivery Driver,"It is all about the numbers and stats for them while delivering under unsafe conditions and unkept vehicles for us.

Amazon,1fertneq2o221802,4,Easiest job ever,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"Definitely not as bad as some people make it out to be, just not somewhere you would like to stay a long time, its an easy job but very repetitive.     "
Amazon,1ferphptht4e2801,1,Don't work here,Amazon Warehouse Associate,They don't appreciate you as a person or a hole they find every single excuse to give you write ups or to try and fire you and the pay isnt that great for being on a forklift
Amazon,1ferpb2n1t4e2800,5,God productive,Picker/Packer,I love the job and tasks I was giving to go through with to get the job done but don\xe2\x80\x99t get it messed up I really feel working hard so it\xe2\x80\x99s really easy
Amazon,1fero7fm7u33u802,1,Worst job I've ever had,Warehouse Worker,"I can honestly say this is the worst job I've ever had, and the bar was set pretty low. Amazon has no respect for its employees as human beings, going so far as to prevent you from using the restroom (a big issue as a female during a certain time of the month...) in an effort to get you to be more productive and have better numbers. Do not work here."
Amazon,1ferhvv5vt4e2802,5,Good place to work,Pallet Builder,Even thought I was part time this was still pretty decent pay compared to minimum wage. It\xe2\x80\x99s a simple job and it\xe2\x80\x99s really good for college students because of the flexibility of the schedule.
Amazon,1ferhdbljt4ep801,3,Alright ,Fresh Associate,"Amazon is an alright company to work for. I worked at a Prime Fresh Warehouse. Keep in mind this means you will be working in different temperature zones, so dress warm."
Amazon,1fer9mag7o221801,1,Run.. Stay away,Associate,"This AMAZON AIR site is a Complete Circus, High School all over again. No Discipline or Accountability, Fake Rules, Associates don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to Managers or PA\xe2\x80\x99S, it\xe2\x80\x99s well known. Standing around & not wanting to work is an understatement. The Pay is Below Par, Physical work in Fingers should be at least $20 or Higher. Micromanagement to the Extreme, Everyone wants to act like a Boss while doing Nothing. And don\xe2\x80\x99t even start with the Pettiness, stay away as far as possible."
Amazon,1fer6pbbvt4e2800,2,It's a job.,Picker/stand lift operator,"Not ideal for military personnel. I would say this is the least military friendly so called ""military friendly"" organization I\'ve worked for in my 18 years of military service. They are constantly stealing my UPT time even though I submit my documentation ahead of time as required. Then I have to forfeit my breaks to hunt HR down to get it corrected which still doesn\'t happen 50% of the time. When that doesn\'t work I have to contact the leave personnel...again. I also have to mention the constant ""do you wish to resign"" auto generated emails and texts I get when I\'m not there because I\'m completing my military obligations. Or being asked by Ops when I return why my UPT time is low or in the negative. It\'s insulting. Other than that its a pretty blah job. You don\'t  have to think. But there are unrealistic expectations. So I definitely don\'t see a future here. Some people in management think a lil too highly of themselves. People are people, regardless of what color vest you wear. So treat them as such. Many also give you different expectations soooo...they clearly aren\'t on the same page. Which in my opinion creates a lose/lose environment.  A few seem ok though. The only pro I can think of is the autonomy of the job. You do what the scanner tells you. "
Amazon,1fer0urlqu3a4801,4,Its easy,Whole Foods Shopper,Its easy but they dont provide thorough training for every possible task you might be assigned which you\xe2\x80\x99d then have to ask someone who might not know how to do the task.
Amazon,1feqpclctu3a4801,3,Very physical work,Ship Dock Associate,In my opinion not worth the pay for the amount of work.  Management is not helpful and they make you think that you can advance but you cant.  There\xe2\x80\x99s also a lot of favoritism
Amazon,1feqjomp2t4e2802,4,Flexible and Worth the Pay,Warehouse Worker,"Amazon is by far the best warehouse I've ever worked in. Safe and efficient. You could be flexible with your hours which is always a bonus. The pay was worth the work, though. I can't say that for other warehouse jobs I've been in. Overall, it's a better warehouse job than most. Try giving it a shot. You may like this warehouse job more than the others you may find.  "
Amazon,1feqjolpr308t002,2,Boring work day,Associate,"The pay is the only reason somebody would work here. It\xe2\x80\x99s an Amazon fresh location in Vernon, and picking grocery orders gets boring real quick when working 10 hour shifts. If your gonna work here stay to Flex instead of full time"
Amazon,1feq44g8jt4ep800,4,"Fast paced, fun place to work",Problem Solver Process Guide,Warehouse is a fast paced environment however the job was simple. Expectations were not outrageous and you are given your benefits and time off up front. Very easy to manage life thoughout the work. They have a very simple and user friendly app for work. Had a great time and made many new friends and had a great team to work with. Also very supportive upper staff that encourage you and also help you take opportunities for growth.
Amazon,1fepupkv3u33u801,4,Good pay and benefits for the work. Poor communication.,Warehouse Associate/Forklift Operator,"The motto is ""it\'s still day one"" at Amazon and you understand what that really means the longer you work there. They have a tendency to make the same mistakes due to the high turnover rate and shuffling of management so frequently; in just four years there I\'ve had two dozen+ managers and assistant managers. They are not the most consistent company nor the best at communicating. Most of our pertinent news must be obtained by reading the bathroom walls...literally they disperse company news and upcoming events on papers called ""installments"" posted on the bathroom stalls. The pros are that the work can be monotonous at times but is not hard especially for the pay which is pretty competitive starting at $16+ an hour. I make $19.60 after 4 years. The benefits are good too. Relatively cheap medical, three days off a week, vacation paid time off and unpaid time accumulating to over 280 hours, sick leave and bereavement, 401k options with 4% matching as well as a stock buy in program. They no longer give monthly productivity bonuses or annual stock awards anymore though. "

Amazon,1fep2a1pku33u801,3,fast paced and hard labor,Package Handler/Sorter,It was a great job and environment was safe and the staff was very nice. Pay was also good but flexibility was an issue. You could never change your hours unless you were in school.

"
Amazon,1feovflnbu3a4800,1,EHS Manager,"Safety, Health and Environmental Manager","Awful place to work. Work life balance is garbage and it will suck the soul right out of you. Would not recommend working in management with Amazon. It\xe2\x80\x99s the quickest way to get fired. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen many other employees perform incredibly well and even raise the bar. However, all it takes is one disgruntled employee for something as simple as not getting the shift they want to send a bunch of lies to corporate HR and they let you go, just like that."
Amazon,1feol8pghu3a4801,1,Boring and Isolated,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"You stay in one section by yourself, don't even have time or room to make friends and the people were rude. Had someone at the same level who was bossy and tried to tell me what to do for him to be able to move up as manager but was rude about it"
Amazon,1feok8elst4e2802,4,"High Turnover, Little movement upwards",Process Assistant,"I loved working here but after a certain point you don\'t really start believing the ""You would be a great manager!"" but then never even getting interviews for a manager spot.

Amazon,1fenrh1k5u3a4800,3,Okay Job,Amazon Warehouse Associate,If anything the benefits as in health insurance make up for the boring shifts and numbers you're supposed to hit. Management will micromanage you if you're not going fast enough.
Amazon,1fenr24soo221802,1,horrible ,Associate,"If you like having no social life then I suggest this job. You only earn about 30 minutes of pto for your 40 hour week. The pay was decent, but compared to the amount you work it really just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth it to me. I would never advise anyone to work at amazon, because at the end of the day, they DO NOT care for their employees AT ALL. In all honesty it felt like prison work. "
Amazon,1fenni6mfu33u800,5,Warehouse ,Warehouse Worker,Long hours good pay. Warehouse is hot in summer and cold in the winter. Benefits are ok. Just depends on what you consider to be good. Weekend work is required 
Amazon,1fenk5jb7t4e2801,5,I like it ,Warehouse Associate,It\xe2\x80\x99s a good spot to work. It\xe2\x80\x99s busy and requires strength and focus. You work 10 hour shifts but the pay is good and well worth it. Amazon isn\xe2\x80\x99t that bad a place to work. 
Amazon,1fenh0ka6u3a4802,5,Great ,Associate,A very great environment to work at and is great at mananging the departments to be at the fullest potenital. I like my schedule and work life balance.
Amazon,1fench5ivu3a4802,2,Over worked ,wearhouse worker,They barley train you and then they just throw you to the wolves basically. They will tell you that your body will get used to it and that\xe2\x80\x99s a lie unless your used to that type of work it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth it  
Amazon,1fen2an8l308t001,3,It’s not the best or worst ,Fulfillment Associate,It\xe2\x80\x99s an okay place to work. The hours are long and during peak seasons a lot of extra time is called so it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty impossible to have a second job. The pay is okay and it\xe2\x80\x99s often pretty mindless work which is nice some days and horrible others. It\xe2\x80\x99s tough on your body and the managers have a weird forced vibe but I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked at worse places. 
Amazon,1fen1mmabu33u800,1,"not bad, management sucks",Packer,Management sucks and is undermining. You cannot move up here and the people who are in leadership positions ensure that. Long hours standing all shift with little to no time for break. 
Amazon,1femukgh5308t000,2,This is a non-sort warehouse,FC Associate I,Stowing quotas are practically unachievable and once you get your first written warning they watch you like a hawk. They expect everyone to work as fast a machine. Wouldn't recommend unless your only there for 3-4 months. 
Amazon,1femtet43308t000,2,high stress,engineer,"Wlb is bad, constantly oncall, but the pay is good, though the stock get to you only after year 2 which isnt that great. Benefits are good, but you might feel lost as its such a large ckmpany"

There are some days you'll encounter rough nights, then you'll have good days. The benefits are great and pay are decent. They also have a career choice program for those that want to go into a career field after one year as a blue badge. Overall I was pretty satisfied during my tenure at Amazon"
Amazon,1femjfnngt4ep801,3,"productive, fast paced, nice people. ",FC Associate I,They\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to you about rates and job performance on your second day and don\xe2\x80\x99t care about life out of work. They\xe2\x80\x99ll call MET (Mandatory extra time) almost every week with no disregard for your life out of there. 
Amazon,1femgqrgvt4e2800,1,associate are good people,Picker,10 hour days rate per hour care more about the customer than employees.     Management younger out of college with no experience as a managenent.  foreignerstreated better  .  physical depend on body.  fellow associates
Amazon,1fem255snt4e2800,3, Great if you like fast paced work,Customer Service Representative,"Amazon has a bad rep and is very understandable considering what some of the warehouse workers go through. I worked as a virtual customer service rep and it started great, I got the hours I wanted, pay was $15 and benefits were amazing. But it got old fast, having people yell at you because of delivery drivers was draining so I left after not being able to move to a different position."
Amazon,1fem07g0tu33u802,2,Its a job,Warehouse Worker,"Alright job. Pay was 18 for night shift. Which is pretty nice. Boring work really, but a jobs a job. Mandatory overtime during peak season, and any other high volume weeks. Mandatory overtime can get you to 50 to 60 hours a week. If you want more money thats an incentive i guess. "
Amazon,1felveosju33u802,4,Very boring but good pay,Shopper,"like any job you don\xe2\x80\x99t wanna be there, but $15 an hour is good pay. i worked part time and i didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to anybody. it feels like a dystopian future job where you\xe2\x80\x99re mainly ordered by a computer to do tasks."
Amazon,1felqruo6o221802,5,Excellent benefits and lots of opportunity to advance,Maintenance Technician 3,"Great place to work as a maintenance technician, climate controlled facilities and all uniforms are paid by company. Lots of opportunities to advance."
Amazon,1felq7nlqu33u802,1,Amazon is not a good place to work,Fulfillment Associate,"We all know the problems with Amazon; long hours, low pay. a BILLIONAIRE off the backs of low paid workers. They work you like you\xe2\x80\x99re a robot, might as well start rolling them out, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99re making them. "
Amazon,1felq2006u3a4802,4,Easy money work isn't to demanding,Packer,So Amazon as a packer was quite easy I only left because of a life situation but I would go back the pay is good if you don't like talking to people it's the job for you
Amazon,1felk17cvu33u800,1,Hardwork,warhouse worker,This job is a fast paced hard working job. I come home looking battered and bruised everyday. The pay is okay the time off policy is great. The employee discount is horrible. I got $1.37 cents off a $56 dollar order. Male is make sense. For us to make the Amazon world go round we sure don't receive much appreciation. 
Amazon,1feli69ndu33u802,3,Okay ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Amazon was a good job if you are in need for a job ASAP or you want a temporary job. Shifts are 10 hours long 4 days a week. You work hard and only get 15 min breaks. 
Amazon,1fel96gebt4e2801,4,Definitely not what people say it is ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"You have to work here for yourself to see if you will like it, got 3 breaks with 12 shift. Two 30 min breaks and one 15 min break. A lot of walking I lost weight lol which was the goal ! The atmosphere is nice everyone will help you if you need it ! I was a cmh4 definitely would go back. It is hard labor lol but as long as you stay with in your status you are fine ! Great Benifits they even have pet insurance great pay ! 3 12hr shifts plus over time when you want to ! Your check would look lovely! "

Amazon,1fel0ou0vo221802,4,Productive,Fulfillment Associate,Good place to work. Have to be known to advance. Workload can be stressful depending on what you do. If you do a critical role don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to get paid more you will get paid the same to do a level 3 associates job.
Amazon,1fel06563t4ep800,4,Fun place to work,Associate 1,I enjoyed working at Amazon because the management there always tried to make work fun even when it was hard. I worked part-time but I could always pick up another shift if I wanted to.

Amazon,1fekv3r3su33u802,3,"Good pay, bad work environment ",Warehouse Associate,Amazon honestly does not care about their employees at all. They entice them and manipulate them by offering relatively high pay for an entry level job.
Amazon,1feku2s5pu33u800,3,Wharehouse associate,wharehouse worker,"rates you are expected to hit are also very unrealistic, and for a company that is owned by the richest man in the world and is able to get packages to its customers in two days or even one day."

I felt like I was in grade school."
Amazon,1fekpf87tu3a4802,5,Fast environment ,General Laborer,"In my personal opinion I feel Amazon is one company that offer the best benefits out there which I think it's the reason why people stay there for such a long time, but there is lack of opportunity to grow inside of the organization, Overall I enjoy working at Amazon because there is a lot of flexibility, benefits and the culture is inspiring."

Amazon,1fekepavpt4e2800,2,Sucked ,Warehouse Associate,This place sucked. They don\xe2\x80\x99t value their hardest workers and let people who slack off continue to do so. Meanwhile expecting the utmost from you. They also play favorites and there is a lot of fraternization. You get worked to near death-with forced overtime. 
Amazon,1feke180l308t002,2,A great place to sell your soul and get rich,Senior Software Development Manager,"I spent four years in middle management at Amazon. I was leading software engineering teams. A typical day would start at 8 AM with video calls to European teams. Then several regular meetings (an average of 2-3 per day), and if you have a team in India, 9 pm video meeting with that team. The work was interesting and always different and there were a lot of opportunities to learn from very smart people. However, the culture is ""dog eat dog"". Creating and developing a strong team isn\'t as important as getting results even if it means you burn out your team and they leave. I made more money here than anywhere else I\'ve worked, and I don\'t think it was worth it. "
Amazon,1fekd9r7hu33u800,1,Horible,Sorter/Packer,"Place just sucks manager doesn't care about you at all, pay had gotten a little better but it really doesn't help when the culture there is to work to death and die bye"
Amazon,1fek4itdru3a4801,3,Productive/fun place to work ,Picker/Packer,They have amazing benefits. I was going to school while working here and management will be really understandable about the times I would take my class and give me time to do it. 
Amazon,1fek37bvbu3a4802,2,Not great,Process Assistant Manager,"Amazon is one of the biggest companies in the world, and as such, the turnover is, expectedly, quite High. If you are looking for a fast paced job, this is it. The benefits and pay are good, especially if you are an external hire. However, if you are an internal promotion, someone just coming out of college can be making more than you, even though you have been with the company for years. "
Amazon,1fejnrh1gu3a4801,1,Terrible ,Packer/Shipper,HR does not care for you terrible company. Not to say you only have five minutes to use the restroom and if you go over they write you up! Pay is barely decent enough for the work you do
Amazon,1fejkhf57u33u800,4,I loved working for Amazon,Amazon Warehouse Associate/ Coach," there's plenty of opportunity for growth within the company they are now offering sign on bonuses that are awesome and you definitely will make a lot of money because you always be working during peak season plenty of overtime and you work so hard you even lose weight so for me that was an extra bonus. And the people I worked with were great, no complaints there. The only except is that there wasn't enough time in the day and I was too exhausted for quality family time & life outside work but then when peak season over you have a more even work/life balance. "
Amazon,1fejhgjeuu33u802,2,Modern day sweat shop,Picker,Repetitive work days. you have to meet rates or you are written up.  Short breaks and lunch. No incentives. It was a steady pay check. Hated the job  but I met some good people.
Amazon,1fejdvrrvu33u802,1,Management plays favorites , Inventory Specialist PillPack,Not much to say. There are a lot of managers that have the favorites. It is a blame culture and not an open door like the claim. Old building at the mils that have spiders all trough out the windows.
Amazon,1fejcfi4et4e2802,2,"Nice looking offices, free food , terrible management and toxic culture.",Sr. Technical Talent Acquisition Specialist,"(Tech Recruiting contract) I appreciated the salary but I had NO support from management. Is a common thing apparently. I was harassed at work and I had no management to make a complaint to, I didn't even know none of their policies.  management changes every 3 months on average. The culture is toxic (some teams are better than others) I don't recommend this place at all!"
Amazon,1fejc7m0hu33u800,3,HR is not helpful,Wharehouse Associate,HR is not very helpful. Recently had a death due to COVID and they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t change my shift. Only two breaks for a 10 hr day which is alright sometimes but if you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling ill it makes work miserable 
Amazon,1fejb6dgbt4e2802,2,Lack of guidance/too many middle managers,Ship Dock Associate,"The health benefits are fantastic.The managers do not know how to talk to employees or motivate them. There are way too many middle managers and the majority of them are very lazy. They will not help you when the workload gets heavy.The company claims to train people, but I haven't received any new training in a year.Upper management does not know how to talk to or motivate employees. "
Amazon,1fej8vhknu33u801,4,They will work you really hard. ,Associate,"The hours are awful for the length of time you have to stand. I worked there in 2018 and I still have nerve tremors in my feet from 12 hour shifts. The work was easy and fun. I had great coworkers. After sitting at a desk for 18 years, this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the best career choice for me. Maybe if they had 8 hour shifts I could have stayed. After 8 hours my body couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take anymore. "
Amazon,1fej0mjq8u3a4802,2,Productive Place to work,Warehouse Worker,They work you.  Recommend a back brace here. Stay focused and do your job...people will stay out of your v way.  Good job to pay the bills. Just remember why you are there
Amazon,1feikgq9st4e2800,3,Very Physically Demanding But Good Pay And Benefits ,Amazon Warehouse Associate,The shifts are very physically demanding. Most shifts are 10 -12 hours of standing and climbing. You get 2 or 3 thirty minute breaks depending on the shift. The downside of the breaks are that the break rooms can be around a 5 minute walk or 10-15 depending on where your stationed that day. That can take up a bit of your break and cause more strain on your body depending on how yours legs and ankles are feeling.
Amazon,1feiheu1iu3a4800,4,Pretty easy job ,Shopper,It's an easy job however I didn't have a good experience and trying to get a flexible schedule was hard since most people would take all the jobs. Good pay tho.

Management has favorites doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help you when you need it. Hardest part of the job is long hours and standing in one spot depending on your department but majority are like that. Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to take time off whenever you need it. 
Amazon,1fei2adhju33u802,2,"Long hours, a lot of over time.  Money can be good, but it will cost your time with your family.",Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"High turn over rate, this is not a long term job.

Amazon,1fei1tqjlu3a4802,2,Above average pay for reliable employees,Amazon Fresh Associate,"The only good thing about this job is its pay and flexibility to work, that's it. There's not much opportunity for advancement and, even if you attempt to apply for an advanced position, they might not even need the help in the first place. The management at the Charlotte, North Carolina position was god-awful, spending most of their time overly criticizing everyone who worked there while also spending a ton of time talking behind each other's backs in often debilitating ways. The work culture at the location I worked at was pretty lame and every manager did things differently. I really feel like they didn't train people at all and picked people with attitudes. The style of managerial techniques was all over the place. All this does is create a sort of workplace where employees will pick their favorites and disrespect everyone else who isn't the least bit personable. Some managers will even make things up to create an even more toxic workplace, giving them an even worse turnover rate than they already have.I just don't think this is a good place to work at all. Sure, it pays nice and you get some dope flexibility but to make REALLY good money here, you would have to pick up 10-hour shifts. To anyone who has flat feet or has foot pain, this would not be the job for you. It's honestly trash, at the end of the day."
Amazon,1fehqk9m7u33u800,3,Okay place to work ,Picker/Packer,"Easy job. Physical demand, long hours, especially holiday season 12 hours a day. Worked as picker, packer. Manager gives feedback on your performance every week."
Amazon,1fehokdt1u3a4800,4,Amazon is what you make it ,Fulfillment Associate,"There are lots of opportunities to move up and around if you seek them out. Yes, it can be rough on the body, but there are good perks and the pay is decent. "
Amazon,1feho0dlqt4e2801,5,Work hard/ play hard environment,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"Amazon is a great company there is a place for most people depending on your physical capabilities. The managers and leads are always willing to help push you to greater heights if you desire to move ahead , out motivate you to do your best where you are. The last decision is up to you but I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll love it!"
Amazon,1fehnljihu3a4802,3,No to bad.,Warehouse Worker,They are a ok company to work for if you like long hours. They are always hiring because no one wants to work for 15.50 to be expected to have to have a quota. 
Amazon,1fehm35gpu3a4801,5,Excellent place to work,Stower,I highly recommend Amazon it is a great job with great benefits if you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to work a little hard each day and show up on time. Managers are nice too.
Amazon,1fehia8b1u33u802,3,Good place for young workers who are looking for just a pay check,Associate,"I worked 5 years for the company and can honestly say it's the standard for corporate work structure. If your young and looking for a starter job, Amazon is a good place to get a pay check but nothing else in terms of career or learning experience. You are a number and there to serve the Mr. B."
Amazon,1fehdg4sgu33u802,3,It was fun for a while,Trainer,"If you're an external hire, you're golden. If not, you're not and you'll eventually feel it. There are lots of inexperienced people making way more  money and decisions than experienced people who are stuck waiting to be promoted after external hires and recent college graduates. "
Amazon,1fehbjj8gt4ep800,4,Productive and fun place to be ,Ship Dock Associate,"It was a great place to work, I gained a lot of new friends.  A lot of different people and a lot of different jobs That are suitable for most people."
Amazon,1fehaurctt4ep802,3,Okay,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"Very strict on the rules, HR is unforgiving about time off and leave options. You work hard, fast and accurately and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have no issues with anyone and will fly under the radar. "
Amazon,1feh85u5so221802,1,Total Grind ,Advanced Materials Engineer,The company will work you to death.  I don't recommend anyone come here. I was happy for many the first 3 weeks and then it just got worse and worse. By the end I felt like I was doing 3-4 peoples job and I didn't even have time to see my family. 
Amazon,1feh4pprot4e2800,3,It’s okay ,Fulfillment Associate,"Management does NOT care about you, but they DO care about the numbers you produce. You are worked like a robot. Facilities and treatment reminds you of \xe2\x80\x9cmodern day\xe2\x80\x9d slavery or a sweat shop. Management definitely plays favoritism  and they never keep their word about cross training you for new positions. Management will also do competition and never give you the reward if/when you do win. Overall, it\xe2\x80\x99s a job. "
Amazon,1feh478kgu33u802,3,Pretty flexible,Loader,Amazon is actually pretty decent. It just got bad once the new changes came and they made volumes that were able to be on in 3-4 hr shift into the full 5 hrs. The old managers were really good at what they did and run the place I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know why the new managers made everything run slower. 
Amazon,1feh24bfmu33u800,3,Depends on where you work,Area Manager,"The management in Birmingham, AL was all military, and they had a caste system. If you weren't an officer or a senior non-commissioned officer, you did not fit their system and they used you as much as they could to make you want to move on. If you didn't move on quickly enough, they write you up for trumped up offenses. Lots of backstabbing, and a LOT of taking credit for other people's work in order to get ahead themselves. Run. Run fast, run hard."
Amazon,1fegvlunpu3a4801,3,Productive ,Sorter,Schedule is flexible nice people to work with everything is done thru the A to Z app which is easier for employees good job for students people with goals
Amazon,1fegvea50u33u800,1,Zombie state inducing or stress inducing environment ,Packer,Management is not helpful or well informed. Everyone is trained inconsistently so nobody is in the same page for how work should get done. The sole focus is speed even though they preach safety as a company. The schedule you are guaranteed when you apply isNot guaranteed. They have changed in on so many people before the first day of work and said that it is the only shift available. There are seasonable employees that have been there before last years holidays that are not hired on. Getting into management is like moving mountains if you don\xe2\x80\x99t kill yourself at work regularly. Leadership gets moved around between different locations much more than promotions from within. 
Amazon,1fegsi6g0t4e2802,5,I enjoyed my job at Amazon ,Warehouse Package Handler,"I liked the established structure of the warehouse process. The management was fair and dependable. It was easy to pickup extra shifts. Safety is encouraged and monitored. The pay was fair. They supplied safety gloves, earplugs, and other disposable tools to do the job. Very positive experience. "
Amazon,1fegrj175308t002,1,Hard Labor intensive not made for everyone ,Stower/Picker,"Job is excruciating, not made for anyone. Everyone who believes Amazon is easy for the pay its worth, the pay is definitely not worth the grueling dreariness and despair that is the mega cycle. To work 1am-12 is just sad, the amount of stress and pain it puts on the back. Go home dragging just to wake up the next night feeling the same way u felt when u got off work. Breaks and lunches are barley enough time to ease the pain. Quit Amazon while you can, it\xe2\x80\x99s the best choice for your health and mind. When it comes to work and health, health comes first, don\xe2\x80\x99t throw ur back away for 15 an hour. Rest more or just quit."
Amazon,1fegp6437308t002,4,It was a good place to work as a student,all positions from picker to auditor to icqa/pa,"Amazon was an excellent place to work, if you are not lazy. They did a lot for me.  They paid for me to go to school.  The benefits were excellent. They paid for my childrens braces."
Amazon,1fegnl1r6308t000,4,DLA7 great place to work,Sortation Associate,"Best location to work because it is not that physically demanding.  Learned problem Solve, stowing, diverting, every scanning, traffic controller, unloader."
Amazon,1fegauq88u33u802,5,Good pay and benefits,Fulfillment Associate 1,"Good pay and benefits, but in management and opportunities of work advancement very poor. To much favoritism. If you finish your schedule they send you to cleaning or you have to go home using your PTO or VTO. "
Amazon,1feg95eb7t4e2800,4,Good pay and schedule,Returns Processor,Pay is great work can get stressful. People are nice and try to help. Working in inbound if you are assigned with a good station for the day it will be easier to make rate                                                        
Amazon,1feg15ov2t4e2801,5,Simple Job,Inbound Stow,"Working at Amazon, I Was In my first trimester of pregnancy & I was able to do my job without any problem. If I needed a heavy container lifted, Someone Would Always Assist. "
Amazon,1feg11a7ao221802,1,Amazon sucks! ,Warehouse Associate,"Worst job i ever worked at. Everyone hates being there so that makes the environment 10x worse. Constantly things are breaking. The managers hate their job, and are rude just like every other person that works there. 1/10 place to work. Yes the pay seems nice, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible work environment that will suck the life out of you. you work 3-4 days a week, so you have longg shifts and are incredibly drained even on your days off. "
Amazon,1fefvr1mh308t000,3,Plantation Amazon,Warehouse Associate,The rate of production is very demanding & management constantly harassed you the entire shift telling you to do more and go faster with no incentive.
Amazon,1fefkqrfju3a4800,3,Decent place to work,Warehouse Associate/ Problem Solver,I worked for Amazon for over five years before I left. It was a decent place to work if you worked well. The management there was not the best always rotating and going through managers. The other employees made the job enjoyable. It is a fast-paced work environment and you will be moving and sweating consistently. Overall if you are not a hard worker you will not last.
Amazon,1fefiv9kkt4e2800,4,Rewarding,Delivery Driver/Warehouse,Rewarding place to work. Benefits are good. Part time work available if you rather. Nice employees to work with and management is great. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t worked there long enough to know more
Amazon,1feff6m8du3a4800,3,The fact that the employee experience is not embraced,Fulfillment Warehouse Associate,"Your typical work day depends on your dept; packing, picking, stowing, etc., and your position; associate, process assistant, learning ambassador, etc. If the workforce at that location is not extremely large, you are able to pick up and learn different positions. Most times you are constantly doing one or maybe two positions repetitively. Workplace culture is sometimes cliquish in the larger facilities, but more personable in the smaller facilities. The hardest part of the job is prolong repetitive work. The most enjoyable part of the job, is sitting down during break. "
Amazon,1fefdopo2u33u800,3,The good and the bad. What stands out about working at this company,Production Worker,Sucked to be honest and they don\xe2\x80\x99t care about you at all as long as your keeping numbers up for the next day shipping. Pretty decent hours horrible pay for the job and what they ask of you. Pretty nice benefits and cool programs but if you wanna throw away years of your life go right ahead.
Amazon,1fefcv4dtu33u800,1,Amazon only cares about the customer not the workers,Fulfillment Center Associate,"The job is too isolated, and they fire you for any little reason, this is why the turnover rate is so high. They dont abide by state laws i think they pay people to get stuff  done because they for sure are unaware of the laws in the state of missouri."
Amazon,1fef84irrt4ep801,2,Good benefits BUT no work life balance etc,Picker/Packer,"I could only do 4 months at this company. The pay should be way higher for what they expect. I did Thurs-Sat 12 hour shifts, the way they expect you to be a robot is actually insane."
Amazon,1fef5qj0cu33u802,4,productive work place,Package Handler (Seasonal),typical day at work was getting there logging in for the day and wait for orders to come. work place was relaxed no stress which was amazing. work load was not heavy either.
Amazon,1feevcatou3a4800,4,Productive ,Worker,Amazon is a great place to work. Except in the fulfillment center was to much walking for me. Even though I had to drive 38 minutes to get there I felt it was definitely worth the trip.
Amazon,1feev7qlut4ep801,3,Fine ,Warehouse Associate,"Ask you to do more work than you signed up for with no extra pay. Hours are long but work weeks are short. Okay breaks for such long shifts. Management was very good, however. "
Amazon,1feeubfcnu3a4800,5,Productive and fun work enviroment,Associate,"I loved working for Amazon, the only reason I left is due to I moved 100 miles away from the nearest location. They have great pay and benefits.I had a great manager, and coworkers. "
Amazon,1feeqjc49u3a4800,4,Alright,Stower,Job was okay. I worked at the delivery station and it was cool. I had the weekend off but I feel like I just got lucky with that schedule because a lot of people didn\xe2\x80\x99t have it.
Amazon,1feepp62ht4e2802,3,It’s a job,Warehouse Associate,"Mindless warehouse labor job, free dental insurance was a nice offer, good short term employment during pandemic beginning. Not too bad, was a pretty intense cardio workout and the warehouse was always really hot. No sense of individuality though, more of a show up, do your job, and leave place but that was fine. "
Amazon,1feep70pht4ep800,3,Good break from desk job for a few months,Amazon Driver,"It's what you expect. Pay is decent. O/T during holidays is guaranteed.Simple job. Load van in the morning, scan packages, go to the first stop.Most routes could be completed in 8 or 9 hours. 10 hour workdays, 4 days a week. Most will offer you full-time/benefits if hired as a temp for the holidays. "
Amazon,1feekt15ku33u801,4,"Longtime, no ??",Associate,Great for first time experience. Would not recommend for long term. Management is okay. Only worked as part time at a sort center. Good pay with demanding labor.
Amazon,1feeipddvu33u802,3,Easy work long hours,Delivery Driver, Not bad it\xe2\x80\x99s just a job be prepared to work around 70 hours during the peak season stowing is a pain bc the people before you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t put the items on correct shelves 
Amazon,1feeio46uo221801,5,Inclusive work culture,Packer,"There's work for everyone no matter your disabilty, age or gender. Unique, chill work environment. There are monitors to see real time job assignments. "
Amazon,1feeib762o221801,1,Confident? Feeling good about yourself? Bring balance back to your life with Amazon.,Warehouse Associate,"Unfortunately I fear this is a vision of the future for far too many of us. My location is in Portland Oregon, a city I grew up in and have loved. In the last few years it has gone from a picture post card city to the last stop for the ever growing folks who\xe2\x80\x99ve found their home but a temporary dwelling along a freeway or under a bridge. Making it more fitting Amazon has ushered in the grand plan of distribution and the promise of jobs but behind the curtain they are just domestic versions of the proverbial sweat shops that hopefully you\xe2\x80\x99ve only heard about. This is not the beginning of a career path but another accomplice in the death of the American Dream. They package it in seemingly wholesome glitter but the reality is far more maniacal. If it\xe2\x80\x99s just a brief stay of execution or a place to disappear for awhile in anonymity, this is the place. But bring no illusions or dreams dipped in grandeur, this is a sweat shop job and your the meat that they\xe2\x80\x99ve already calculated the turn over for. If you are young starting out, don\xe2\x80\x99t sell yourself short and seek elsewhere and if you must learn what you can but never accept that your home here for remember AMAZON is a jungle filled with creatures all fighting for life , even at the expense of yours."
Amazon,1feefem02u3a4800,2,Busy warehouse environment,Warehouse Associate,"The work itself isn't hard at all, it gets a little mundane and repetitive. It's the people who make the job harder, the fulfilment centers basically hire anyone and you definitely work with an interesting bunch of people"
Amazon,1fee6snk1o221800,3,"You win some, you lose some",None,"Sometimes working here will make you feel like this is the best job ever. Sometimes, well let\xe2\x80\x99s just say you may have to meditate before going in. The job is very hard on your body. Advancement depends on the type of people you work with and the site, some recognize talent and associate value, some play the game of favorites."
Amazon,1fee5d6cju33u802,4,Decent place to work depending on what job you apply for.,Delivery Driver,"I was a deliver driver which are through third party contractors. Its actually  nice you can listen to your music all day, if you like to work alone this is the job for you. You'll be in different areas daily or weekly it just depends and you have an option to try many different places to have lunch. They do have heavy workloads the only difficult thing is the bathroom breaks there's really no place to go to the bathroom. Only major food chain stores like(meijer,Kroger, walmart) had open restrooms due to covid."
Amazon,1fee0vunru33u801,4,Additional job/work duties are not compensated without promotion to higher tier level.,Fulfillment Associate/Stow Associate,Excellent place to work for a younger aged group such as 20-40. The demand is equal for all associates regardless. Work demand is high as with any large corporation it is a numbers only business.Higher numbers mean more recognition buy not a higher pay and bonuses are not used as an incentive for better production.
Amazon,1fedvnu1eu3a4802,3,OverWorked,Sortation Associate,"If you need the money and don't mind working every second, its the job for you. You will be forced to work many mandatory extra time days regardless of the actual need for you to be present at work. "
Amazon,1fedva099u3a4800,1,No room for advancement. ,AFE Packer,"Your nothing but a number. You are scared to go to the bathroom because upon return, you have some young kid in management walking up with a laptop asking why you left and that your rates need to go up. HR is a joke! And the 800# they make you call for everything is ran overseas and you can't understand the operators. "
Amazon,1fedquh60t4e2800,3,Depends on the department.,CSR - Customer Service Representative,"They aren't horrible to work for, but depending on your department you can get some nasty calls. The benefits of the company are phenomenal by far one of the best I've ever been offered by a company."
Amazon,1fedqe3smu33u800,5,Very fast paced,Fulfillment Associate,Over all it wasn't bad. I had a lot to learn but others helped me out a lot. once you get the hang of it things become very easy. Sometimes we didn't have anything to do so we waited till something came up.
Amazon,1fedg7m34u3a4800,2,Don’t do it,FC Associate,"Worst job I\xe2\x80\x99ve had, the psy wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that bad but for the amount of work I\xe2\x80\x99d definitely should have been more. The managers aren\xe2\x80\x99t too helpful when you have problems it was just a mess."
Amazon,1fed9borpo1ir801,3,its ok,Delivery Driver,Its easy but tiring. When it comes to management you have to get lucky with that as I heard of some people complain about other DSP's managers. Plenty of work hours is available though.
Amazon,1fed8o5eghih1801,5,Fun workplace ,Amazon Warehouse Associate,Best job ever great pay and long hours if you tryna make that check work for amazon Breaks are only 10 minutes twice a shift and one 30 minute unpaid break 
Amazon,1fed7rcaphiks801,5,It’s a great job. I love it. Just need to be prepared to be on your feet,Associate,"I love Amazon because the money is great, i have a great work life balance plus i get to advance quick with a company that has great benefits! I only have to say the walking is my only complaint "
Amazon,1fed6fpq0s7en802,2,It kinda sucks but pays well,Picker/Packer,Training is 3 days but they literally hire anyone who breathes. They also aren\xe2\x80\x99t helpful when you have back pain from doing a task nor will it get fixed if multiple people complain about the same thing. 
Amazon,1fecp2r4roshp800,1,"Bad company, making your life  stressful, ",Amazon Flex Delivery Driver,"The  worst  company I have ever seen in my life.  On purpose  making  your job hard, I'll  not recommend  to work with  Amazon,  navigation app gives you  elegal  instructions,  not working properly "
Amazon,1fecop8f13od8002,1,Just dont,Delivery Driver,The worst company you could work for. You could look anywhere else and find something that pays the same for a lot less work. Just look at the news and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see why everyone hates working for Amazon. 
Amazon,1fecmmbh7u38h800,5,Weekly pay and annual raises,Picker/packer,Amazon is a good place to work if you are a fast speedy worker. It can be exhausting if you don't have that in you. The hours are long which are ten not eight for full time workers. So again you must have that in you to carry out the day of working extremely hard the whole shift. The pay is good. It is weekly which helps you maintain your bills throughout the week and month. Amazon is a fun place to work.
Amazon,1feck1h3voshp800,3,Eh,Packer,Sucked to be honest and they don\xe2\x80\x99t care about you at all as long as your keeping numbers up for the next day shipping. Pretty decent hours horrible pay for the job and what they ask of you. Pretty nice benefits and cool programs but if you wanna throw away years of your life go right ahead.
Amazon,1fecim3dspi24802,4,Lots of time off ,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"Work can get pretty repetitive but overall it\xe2\x80\x99s not bad. Pay is decent and they give out a lot of time of opportunities, both paid and unpaid. Also lots of overtime during the peak."
Amazon,1feci2ccapi24800,3,Can be rewarding but it's definitely a Turn n' Burn environment,Investigations Specialist II (ADS-SAIF),"I enjoy what I do but it's clearly turn and burn. I have a lot that I bring to the table and will accept a promotion but likely I will move along somewhere else that will realize and reward my skills faster.The pay tenets suck between sign on, base, and RSU. I'd rather just get the full salary in a paycheck and get paid what I'm worth."
Amazon,1fechslciu38h802,4,"Great, supportive management, Flexible scheduling ",Warehouse Clerk,Can always find a shift to work. Great if you have another job. Management is always supportive. Get paid weekly. Opportunities for growth. Excellent benefits. 
Amazon,1fechrrutt5to802,1,My coworkers were great and had a few good HR reps,Packer,"You got weekly pay and are able to use your phone to clock in and avoid the line. Those are the main reasons to stay. The management doesn\xe2\x80\x99t listen unless they favor you, they\xe2\x80\x99ll throw you in another position with barely any training. They were a new facility that had no idea or plan on how to keep it going. They expect you to meet production every hour even when you are solving your own maintenance issues and run out of product. "
Amazon,1fecffhmlpi24800,5,"Productive, great co-workers, and GREAT PAY!",Warehouse Associate," Working at Amazon was really great, but if you're looking for a part-time job you came to the wrong place. The hours are long and you will be expected to work four days out of the week. Makes it very hard when you're still in or about to begin college."
Amazon,1fec8q5eju38h802,1,it pays the bills,Package Handler,"The job isn't hard, but it is mindless and boring. Feet & body will hurt after each shift. Hours are long. Benefits are okay. Breaks are not long enough & unpaid. "
Amazon,1fec7a1ij3od8002,4,Good Role for Simple People,Area Manager,"As an area manger you work 4 days a week (sometimes 5 on MET weeks) and you don't get to pick your schedule. You're either Sunday-Wednesday or Wednesday-Saturday day or nights.  This role is good for someone who doesn't like to go too much since you are working so much on your feet all day. Honestly it was a pretty solid job, but I'm very social and i think I'm more of a 9-5 person M-F."
Amazon,1fec6er95o2dr802,1,Hated this job,Picker,"It was an awful job. I'm definitely not afraid of work and this job drove me into the ground. Unrealistic expectations bordering on robotic, your health isn't taken seriously and everything counts against you, including your MANDATORY BREAKS. Amazon should be paying its workers more than 15 an hour for mandatory 10+ hour shifts of heavy fast paced work. Bezos can afford it but doesn't pay. Disgusting."
Amazon,1fec66l03u38h800,1,work you to death,Area Manager,"management - paid to watch you work like a dog , wont give you timely brakes, you cant even go to the bathroom without being called outH.R no help at all with concerns "
Amazon,1fec30kuit4d3800,2,Treats you like a robot,Picker,"Working four tens was great, minus mandatory OT, and benefits were great, but the company treats you like a robot. Break rooms were far from most stations and you only had 5 minutes to and from. At the time (2016) they refused to pay a living wage"
Amazon,1fec2i6dku38h800,4,"Zero stress, easy ",Scanner,"Easy job, time goes by fast and no stress\xe2\x80\xa6you can learn new positions if you want.. it\xe2\x80\x99s a good work out cancel your gym membership\xe2\x80\xa6if you want to make easy Money this is the job for you. You just do your task no one bothers you. It\xe2\x80\x99s sort of loud at times and you are always moving so no time to talk.   "
Amazon,1fec02ef3t5to800,5,It was ok,Associate,It was ok what can you expect from a fast high demand job like Amazon. It\xe2\x80\x99s what you can expect at any shipping company really. Supervisors were okay pay was ok. 
Amazon,1feborrva3od8002,1,Sort center is not a good place to work,Fufillment Associate,"When I started at STL5 in November of last year, we had plenty of people on the line to do the job, however not enough equipment for everyone (i.e. hand held scanners). In mid January the management changed & the morning & Day sort shifts became too top heavy with Area managers & operations managers, the Process Assistants on both shifts most were temporary & non got a FT position & now Amazon is expecting regular line people to do the PA's (Process Assistant) job with no extra pay."
Amazon,1febkti643od8000,2,Not The Best ,Warehouse Associate,This company treats you like a robot. Work hard but not appreciated. They do play favorites here too. Everything is monitored. They demand lots from you but they don't apperciate you. 
Amazon,1febkq652pi24802,5,Productive work ,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"The pay is great & the coworkers are nice the work is easy everybody make it seem like it\xe2\x80\x99s slavery work but it\xe2\x80\x99s not it\xe2\x80\x99s regular work , the coworkers are nice and fun"
Amazon,1febbrlso3od8002,3,Ok,Quality Control/material Handler,It\xe2\x80\x99s ok depends on the department you work in and the manager you have to deal with but don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to stay in your department everyday you might have to go unload trucks when they\xe2\x80\x99re short of workers even though that\xe2\x80\x99s not your job position and they don\xe2\x80\x99t care if you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like doing it and they will leave you there til the end of shift almost everyday 
Amazon,1feb519bet4d3800,3,It's Okay,Picker/Packer,"Good for a temporary job, but I wouldn't do it for too long... Might actually hurt yourself long term. Pretty good pay though, so maybe it's worth it."
Amazon,1feb17ktn3od8000,3,okay ,Safety Specialist,They job is what you put into it. It can eat you up if you dont put the work in but if you do you can move up quickly. Management changes constantly. Very fast paced environment. 
Amazon,1feav8kufo2dr802,4,The job isnt too bad.,Amazon Fulfillment Associate (Part-Time),"On regular days the work can be pretty slow and boring,  it gets tough during holiday season and prime day. The work is pretty straight forward you can try all positions and stick to what you are most comfortable with. They offer vto too and you can take pto whenever you want. "
Amazon,1feat7psrt4dh800,2,Typical call center,Customer Service Representative,"Pays ok, however for the work doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pay enough. Work from home destroyed the way this job operated. If your internet had issues or if the power goes out you basically had to find ways to cover the missed work or face backlash. During my last months we had a pretty much ice storm that left many areas without any power, it was expected of you to either get power or use your vacation for something completely out of your control. During the covid crisis with lockdowns there was extended deliveries and issues obtaining certain products, many entitled people felt the need to yell and cuss you out over something you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fix.  It got old quick. Unless you can find a job off direct lines with people, this job may not be for you."
Amazon,1feaonl8d3od8000,1,Run,Receiving Clerk,Not a good fit hiring process cold it was a joke pass a COVID test to hire anyone most people have quit within 6 months if you last longer it will wear you out 
Amazon,1feakbmeru38h801,4,"Flexible decent pay, great benefits, depressing at times ",Amazon Associate,"It\xe2\x80\x99s ok just stay away from Debbie downers, and the management can use a facelift, they need a training on how to talk to do workers. If you want quality workers there needs to be quality employees "
Amazon,1feahsvmat4d3800,1,Urine jugs ,Amazon Delivery Driver,You have to deal with urine jugs from other drivers who leave them in the van overnight. They say you have a set time you get out but then you have around 150 stops mostly 2-3 mins away from each other and even if you run you could still be working 9-10 hour shifts.. not worth it. 
Amazon,1feah86h93od8000,4,Great COVID pay,Virtual Customer Service Associate,But after COVID pay expired it seemed like workload went up and pay went down. Otherwise it\xe2\x80\x99s a great work from home job with great work environment aside from the crazy customers of course
Amazon,1feab75kupi24802,1,horrible,Amazon Warehouse Associate,they don't care about you at all you are a number and will get rid of you faster than you can imagine HR is the reason i will quit this horrible work place
Amazon,1feaap0q03od8000,2,not as bad as everyone says but its still bad,Sorter/Unloader,"Its amazon, enough said, but the managers i had were pretty cool but working 10 hours in a 110 degree warehouse with 100 percent humidity moving thousands of boxes isnt the ideal job for some"
Amazon,1feaa3gad3od8002,5,Fun,Amazon Warehouse Associate,Cool place to work! But the hours are kinda ling and very repetitive! So just keep pushing! Would have never left if I had a good school schedules! Great 
Amazon,1fea48jis3od8001,3,Decent job not good pay,Driver,"Company consistently cannot keep drivers, warehouse workers don\xe2\x80\x99t care about drivers and everyone things that Amazon is an easy job when h deal with the heat. Late start time too"
Amazon,1fea47de03od8002,3,Pros and cons,Warehouse Associate,I've been working at amazon for 8 months. Some of the jobs are better then others. It can be very mentally draining doing the same thing all day everyday.
Amazon,1fea30m08u38h801,3,BWI2 Area Manager,Transportation Area Manager - Transportation Operations Management,Training is not as adequate as senior management believes it is. Answers are sought from lower tier employees but are not known at an indepth level from upper tier employees. Management plays the blame game with every department instead of looking at the data they so desperately want and making decisions on that. The opportunity to promote was abysmal. The constant badgering by senior ops managers and mine particular made work life balance non existent. You are simply and employee in the numbers game.
Amazon,1fe9vq2rit4dh802,3,"Fast paced, minimal breaks, and annoying managers",Order Picker,Working at Amazon can either be flexible with the added bonus it\xe2\x80\x99s only 4days 10hours or it can be miserable working 10 hours doing the same thing over and over again. 
Amazon,1fe9so0m2pi24801,3,Ok,PRIME NOW ASSOCIATE,"It was ok, nothing too exciting but it was not super bad. You are really just a number to them and the managers will never take the time out to get to know you personally."
Amazon,1fe9rsmort4dh802,3,its okay its a job,Picker,it's easy to do but a lot of walking and lifting things. pay is good too and the three days off is really nice too. wish the breaks were longer but its okay overall.
Amazon,1fe9qulutt4d3802,1,Nothing,No I won't.,"It's ALL about Amazon. Was a lot better place to work when it was Zappos. We made less money when it was Zappos, but we were a lot happier working there."
Amazon,1fe9pme8ro2dr800,3,Hard work for rewards,Area Manager,Amazon has a ton of room for advancement. You just have to work hard. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t an easy job you can just go in and do nothing. There is high expectations and the people that exceed have a lot room to advance.
Amazon,1fe9mu15e3od8001,3,Good benefits,Problem Solver,Good benefits. No work life balance. Will hire anybody. Decent wages. If you're desperate for work definitely apply here. Pretty easy to move up if you like the work.
Amazon,1fe9l26jk3od8002,3,Nice coworkers not so much the HR department,Fufillment Associate,Co workers are great.  But the HR department not so much.  A lot of miss communication between worker and HR department.  Would work there again because if the other coworker.
Amazon,1fe9j8mlf3od8000,3,"Terrible scheduling, good pay-work balance",Amazon Fresh Associate,There is absolutely no flexibility in the scheduling. For the work you're doing the pay is good and my coworkers and great. If you work hard you can easily be promoted since it's such a big company.
Amazon,1fe9hb3gq3od8001,3,Alright place to work,Transportation Operations Management,"By no means is working for Amazon as bad as people may make it seem. There's a good work/life balance. You're not allowed to work over 60hrs per week. They won't let you work over 12 hrs in one shift, & you must have 10 hrs off before you;re allowed to work another shift. Plenty of OT opportunities should you want or need some extra cash. Benefits are some of the best I've ever had & pay is pretty good for someone that doesn't have any sort of education beyond high school like myself. BUT, if you're one that takes pride in your work & likes to go above & beyond, I'll stop you right there. Because instead of talking to the other associates and saying you lead by example, they'll ride your butt to improve even more. They give up on low performers & ignore them regularly. Top dogs are watched like a hawk and when they perform average, they'll ask you what's up. As a T1, they're fairly flexible with your schedule. But if you move up the ladder, they're a bit more strict & you might end up working a shift pattern that you're not wanting/willing to work. Management is weird. You either end up with people that'll support you or people that couldn't care less about what happens to you and will treat you like a number over a person. It's not the worst work environment ever. I've had far worse. But this is definitely not a place I wanna work at any longer than I have to. Oh & you better not need to talk to HR about anything. They're practically non-existent & if you for whatever reason need to go on a medical leave, good luck. They make you submit paperwork, then say more is needed, then"
Amazon,1fe9haq85t4dh802,4,Better than a fulfillment center!,Air Gateway Associate,"KRIV is an AirHub for Amazon, and honestly I loved it. The hours were good ( at least for the sunrise shift )and it was not heavy work load. Only reason I decided to leave was because they were not having conversions to become a blue badge (permanent associate) so I was basically waisting my time as a ""seasonal"" because my time already there would not be counted. Wasn\'t a big warehouse so there was not a lot of walking. Management was ok, could be better, but I did get along with most managers. 9/10 would return to to KRIV."
Amazon,1fe9g71f2t4dh800,4,Hard work gets recognized,Warehouse Associate,"Decent place to work part time or full time. Management was decent majority of the time, there were some questionable decisions made but employees are treated with respect."
Amazon,1fe9efod93od8002,3,"Warehouse job, boring, what do you expect",Associate,"Managers make all the difference, some good some bad, and they change regularly.Move stuff and put it in boxes, boringly simple.Most stress free job I ever had, but most of my managers were good to work with.  I've heard horror stories about other managers.Just don't get caught up in a corporate problem, will never get fixed.Decent pay for the work, great benefits, ability to move up to management, but you will have to work extremely hard for it and possibly make the right friends.I didn't hate it as much as I thought I would.Great place for someone just starting out who is willing to really bust their butt to get ahead.  Put in a few years, become a manager and then take that experience to another company.Just don't take it too seriously, you can't change or fix anything, corporate culture will take it's toll if you let it.Forget the place even exists as you walk out the door and enjoy life.Just make sure you are on time for your next shift."
Amazon,1fe9bph69pi24800,3,No place for growth ,Safety ,"I worked for Amazon for 2 years & had an interim  position which is like the stepping stone for becoming a tier 3. Yet I got no support from my leadership, nor HR when it came time for me to move forward. I was interviewed with little advice on Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s interview process and did not even receive an incline despite the hiring manager giving mainly positive feedback about me. After my interim position came to a close they wanted to just throw me back onto the floor as if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t build my experience the last year for something more. "
Amazon,1fe9a721d3od8002,5,Amazon Account Security.,Account Security,It was okay. The atmosphere was good but the work load was extremely repetitive. The overall atmosphere was good though. I would recommend it for everyone.
Amazon,1fe994lva3od8002,1,Not a good place,Packer,Not a good place to work at all they fire people all the time for productivity and other issues very stressful when you have to work mandatory overtime especially if you have small children 
Amazon,1fe96dsv1pi24800,3,toxic workplace ,Picker/Packer,managers are always on your back to stay at an acceptable workplace when they know that it\xe2\x80\x99s basically impossible to hit the rates that they demand of you at a constant rate
Amazon,1fe95cqmepi24801,4,Sometimes can be hard to learn new things depending on position ,Picker,"Working as an Amazon flex associate isn\xe2\x80\x99t bad at all. The pay isn\xe2\x80\x99t as much as other warehouses but it\xe2\x80\x99s alright. There is drama just like any other facility and as long as you get your work done no one will bother you. Although that\xe2\x80\x99s the nice part, it can be hard to advance. "
Amazon,1fe91nocm3od8000,2,Too physically demanding ,CPT Chaser,I loved doing CPT chasing in the beginning but now it is getting to be too demanding on my body. I walk anywhere between 15 and 20 miles in a single shift. The pay is not enough for the work people put in at Amazon. 
Amazon,1fe8vuc01t4d3802,5,Great company that treated me well.,Operations Manager,Amazon.com is a great company that will let you grow as far as your ambitions will carry you.  Amazon always treated me very fairly and let me earn a good living for my family.  No complaints.

Amazon,1fe8d94lgo2dr800,1,No life outside of work,Warehouse Associate,No life outside of work. They over work you for no reason. They put you in positions you didnt even apply for. Work load is heavy without any help. Expected to pull over 100 lb boxes with no team work. 
Amazon,1fe8ce89vu38h800,4,Enjoyable when you begin but does becoming repetitive and boring ,Flex,I loved working for Amazon for the first 7 months but after a while I started to lose my drive and got bored. Shifts were really long it drove me crazy

Amazon,1fe7247th3od8001,5,Physically productive and fun at times,Sortation Associate,"The hardest part of the job is in the beginning, where your body is adjusting to to the work load and hours. After getting adjusted, things become much easier. More-so, with the company offering (VTO) voluntary time off whenever associates exceed workload. There is a $1 differential for night shift as well."
Amazon,1fe71vth1o2dr802,1,To much work not enough pay simple ,Associate,To much work for little pay. Treat there associates like robots. Pay way to little and expect so much can\xe2\x80\x99t even use the restrooms without have someone bothering you 
Amazon,1fe6sp1kv3od8000,3,Its okay if you want to be a robot,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"Work is okay, but i personally feel like I m just slaving away like a robot everyday just doing what im told. Of course its not the worst place to work, but there are better options"
Amazon,1fe6oh653t4dh802,2,some good days and bad day working here,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,sometimes you don't have the right things to work with but it's the communication for no one like to communicate at all they'll rather have you working against yourself because they feel like its the best thang but it's not
Amazon,1fe6l4vknu38h800,4,Environment ,Warehouse Associate,Working alone and being in your own zone is a plus. Good schedules but mandatory MET can get annoying especially when it comes out of nowhere. Some managers are cool but others are whatever 
Amazon,1fe65a33nt4dh802,1,Okay if you can get shifts,Whole Foods Shopper,For my duration as a Whole Foods shopper I was dissatisfied with the manner to get shifts through their App. 3 times a week they released shifts which lasted 30 seconds if you\xe2\x80\x99re lucky to tap on 1 that\xe2\x80\x99s when you worked and that\xe2\x80\x99s for only 1 day. I was waking up at 3 am to hopefully get a 4 am shift. You can\xe2\x80\x99t add shifts until you\xe2\x80\x99re finished with the one you started. The on-site manager provided zero assistance in anything. In other words you\xe2\x80\x99re on your own yet timed by metric counts on how long it takes to complete an order. If you take too long the order is taken from you and given to another shopper.  There are no 15 min breaks. Pay was good IF you get work. Left to find a job with steady hours.  Good in a pinch for short term work.  No benefits of any kind - no nothing not even grocery discount. 
Amazon,1fe62dh2su38h800,5,Good,Warehouse Associate,"Great awesome enjoyable, this place is fast paced but time flies and you feel sense of purpose. They offer free snacks and coffee. The people are great and it's just a good environment all in all."

Amazon,1fe5iridju38h802,3,It’s okay. It can be stressful sometimes. Depends on the location ,Amazon Associate,It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. It can be stressful sometimes. Depends on the location. I personally do not recommend working at the Euclid location because they treat you more like a robot than a person because they want to keep up with the rates.
Amazon,1fe5bfhn1u38h800,3, Tiring ,Transportation Manager," Long hours, not much room for advancement unless you are willing to relocate. Pay is ok, but they will work you to make sure you make rate or you get in trouble. "

God forbid you\xe2\x80\x99re in the bathroom a minute longer than allowed, you\xe2\x80\x99re written up. The warehouse is huge, takes 3-5 minutes just to reach a bathroom depending on your location in the building. If it\xe2\x80\x99s busy season and you\xe2\x80\x99re not working as fast as their insane rate of pace then you\xe2\x80\x99re written up. They pop up with mandatory overtime at random and if you can\xe2\x80\x99t bend your schedule to be there for the overtime then you\xe2\x80\x99re written up or fired. This is a terrible job if you\xe2\x80\x99re in school or have children because they are not flexible and change your schedule anytime they want and give mandatory overtime at a moments notice."

Amazon,1fe4ds3pepi24802,1,No benefits for drivers.  DSP owners govern by fear tactics,Delivery Associate,"Working for an Amazon DSP is a dead end job.  The owners  will post a delivery job to hire people.  They will say it is a 10 hour shift, four days a week.  Amazon pays the owner for 10 hours for every shift they accept.  Then the owner will turn to the drivers and instruct them to get done in under eight hours.  If the driver is not getting done, they can and most likely will be written up.  Amazon makes each route based on a ten hour shift.  DSP owners will ask drivers why they aren\'t working faster.  If a driver does get done in under eight hours, the owner will have them go take packages off another driver to get the other driver done in under eight hours.  They will then write up the other driver for being ""rescued"".  Routes are rarely corrected.  Drivers don\'t have access to restroom facilities.  The whole time the driver is doing their job, there is a camera fixed on them recording everything.  Suggestion is to stay away from Amazon."

Amazon,1fe3so6skpi24800,3,Just another cog,Warehouse Associate,The company has a hiring system and positions designed to quickly hire naive workers for strenuous jobs.

Amazon,1fe2d8cekt4dh802,3,Busy,Packer,You definitely have to be ready to keep up. The benefits are great. The most annoying thing for me was the rush at the time clock and during shift end.
Amazon,1fe1hvpl2u38h802,5,I love working for Amazon because I've had worse jobs,Learning Ambassador,"I have enjoyed my time at Amazon-- fast-paced work that I don't get bored doing for a decent pay rate. The benefits are great, especially the college reimbursement program and health/dental/vision. As long as you don't overuse and abuse your paid and unpaid time off, it's easy to accommodate a good work-life balance because you can take off whenever you need to. I like having a set schedule so there are no surprises (aside from mandatory overtime days that are clearly defined at date of hire). It's pretty easy to advance your career at Amazon if you have the ambition."
Amazon,1fe1h7iq53od8002,1,It is dependent on where you go,Team Member,"The warehouse I work for is very physically demanding. I knew this to some extent. However, this one is way more physically demanding then other warehouses (not that they tell you that beforehand). It requires you to walk the length of the football field everyday,constant standing and bending over, strenuous lifting, and if you don't meet the almost crazy times you get written up and later on fired. I heard the one by the airport is nice. Try working there instead."
Amazon,1fe1fsdulu38h802,3,Not enough caring for there team members,Picker,Human resources do not try to help you on nights and always giving that feeling of loosing your job. No compassion at all. Not all are liked that but it is a few that throws there weight around.
Amazon,1fe1fp26ct4dh802,5,Good Management ,Process Sorter,I worked a few weeks and was offered full time immediately.  The company gives you 30 unpaid time off the back and you earn PTO every pay period.  Nice group of people to work for and was offered a second position after 3 months. Loved this job!
Amazon,1fe1bt2qit4d3802,4,Productive but tedious work most days,Picker,"Depending on your job, working could be pretty laid back with the exception of extremely busy order days. I was an order picker so I mostly worked continuously all day unless the robots or the conveyor malfunctioned, which was about 2-3x a week so I just brought a book for those times. Most managers are pretty cool but you\xe2\x80\x99re always gonna have a few that get under your skin for whatever reason. Overall it\xe2\x80\x99s a good job, just physically demanding and time consuming. "
Amazon,1fe1ag16du38h800,5,Good pay for repetitive work,Warehouse Associate,"Overall I enjoyed working at Amazon. My job was a warehouse employee and I enjoyed getting paid $15 an hour and how easy the hiring process was. The job itself was fairly easy with occasionally having to lift a very heavy item. However, coworkers were usually always willing to give a hand."
Amazon,1fe1a54h8o2dr800,3,Picker,Picker/Packer,"Easy work, comes with great benefits. Hard to advance. You always see new faces people don\xe2\x80\x99t stick around for a long time. Great starter or in between job but nothing more"
Amazon,1fe15b6uau38h801,4,Productive place to work ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Everything is always moving. No rest time. Alright pay for the work being done. Managers are lenient with many of the rules. Fun people to work with. 
Amazon,1fe158coqt4d3801,2,Amazin does not allow their employees to even prosper in the company.  Constant turnover,Packer,If you need a job and insurance to take care of yourself and family. Amazon has those opportunities.  However be prepared to be hounded for hitting rate daily.  You're given a very short time to dwell in that area
Amazon,1fe13uriot4dh800,1,Horrible place to work!!!!,"Order Picker/Forklift Operator,",You are just a number!!!! Obscene amount of favoritism!!! Horrible place to work!! All they do is harass you!! Stay away!!!!! Poor management!! Don't do it.....
Amazon,1fe0veidgt4dh802,1,Brutal,Packer/Fulfillment Employee,"Easy as heck, but the repetition gives you too much time to think. You can pack over 30 boxes in 5-10 minutes, which makes time seem super slow. Breaks are 3.5 hours apart."
Amazon,1fe0j6a0u3od8002,3,Boring and Tiring,Sortation Associate,"The job itself is very tiring and mundane. Sometimes you are backed up and sometimes there is nothing to do. When there is nothing to do, often times the managers expect you to do something and they constantly bug you. This warehouse handles mostly large packages."
Amazon,1fe0himvmu38h800,3,Productive and fun work,Associate Warehouse,"If you want a part time with flexible hours then thus is the right place for you is all day shifts and you get plenty hour if they need you, but is very poor management "
Amazon,1fe0bh4a5o2dr802,2,Unorganized management,Associate,Unorganized management amazon is a place to work . Management doesnt know what they are doing. Lots of unfair treatment and favoratism. Cool for a temp first job
Amazon,1fe0b1qtlt4d3801,3,Great place to Start ,Problem Solver/Ambassador,"Great work culture, Great benefits and pay, open door policy, management engagement with associates is pleasant, fun activities and events , free meals sometimes . The only thing I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really like is the \xe2\x80\x9c organized chaos\xe2\x80\x9d management would labor share you to different departments"
Amazon,1fe0b0t78o2dr801,4,The job is boring. But there is tons of opportunity for advancement.,Order Picker/Forklift Operator,"The job is boring, you\xe2\x80\x99re doing the same thing all the time and you can\xe2\x80\x99t listen to music .but there is tons of opportunity for advancement. Management is super helpful if you want to climb the corporate ladder"
Amazon,1fe043f8opi24802,2,Definitely not an easy paycheck,Area Manager,"There were good days and bad days, but overall the expectations are too high, even for what seems like good compensation. Expect 50-60 hour workweeks with no breaks even for lunch. There is almost no training for AMs, they just throw you on the floor and expect you to know everything. I did enjoy getting to know associates and helping them, though."
Amazon,1fe03pgcvt4dh802,3,Lots of overtime opportunities ,Packer/customer care,Lot of overtime opportunities if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for them high stress during nov-dec which is called peak season because it\xe2\x80\x99s the highest volume of sale. 
Amazon,1fe0136bso2dr802,4,Good Place To Work ,Warehouse Associate,Very Easy Job. Managers are friendly. They help you with everything you are tasked. Friendly people you work with. Clean environment. Pay could be better. Benefits are also be better. 
Amazon,1fdvqcabfu38h800,3,"Good hours but lack of growth, no one teaches you other jobs.",Package Handler/Sorter,I like that it's a very productive job site. What I don't like is I haven't learned very little since I have been with the company. I also feel like there are very few supportive team leaders. I have only meet 2 since I joined the company in April 2021.
Amazon,1fdv5q114t4dh800,2,"Fast pace, lots to learn ,very stressful, hours",Area Manager,"Wow, what can I say it's alot. If you think your ready think again.  Honestly, this company cares about meeting metrics, goals,etc.  Pays little to no mind to their AM's.  You either learn to be resilient quickly or you feel like your drowning. The scheduling is tough on your body, if you struggle with anxiety I wouldn't recommend this unless you feel ready for the stress.   Depending on the people you work with it can be toxic, pay is okay but realistically not enough for the health, work or stress that the role puts you in. Think twice if youre a college hire because it's not for everyone. "
Amazon,1fdunn5mdt4d3802,3,Okay place to work,Flex Customer Service Representative,"Training wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that great, they throw you into the job. The pay doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match with the amount of work you have to do daily. The scheduling is flexible but that\xe2\x80\x99s if you click into the shift bids in time."
Amazon,1fdulqbgm3od8002,2,Long hours and repetitive ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"10 hours standing in one place doing the same thing takes a toll, the pay is good for the level of work but the management in whole leaves a lot to be desired."
Amazon,1fdug67liu38h802,3,Benefits,Inbound Stower,"It\xe2\x80\x99s a job. Expectations are high, and it\xe2\x80\x99s hot in the warehouse. Break times are cut because by the time you get to break from walking/going down stairs, a chunk of your break is gone, because you need to count that same amount of time going back up. "
Amazon,1fduci377o2dr802,2,"Decent pay, hard work, no flexibility, management could care less about you",Warehouse Associate,"Working in the logistics warehouse was a nightmare. Constantly understaffed, and required to work 50 hours a week at times, and 60 hours a week during \xe2\x80\x9cpeak\xe2\x80\x9d times. You can\xe2\x80\x99t take a moment to rest outside of scheduled breaks or else you can be written up. Unless you pass out or throw up first. Their pto system and time off system is flawed and unless you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose your job don\xe2\x80\x99t plan on taking many days off if you\xe2\x80\x99re sick or want to take time off for a trip. The only upside was the insurance and pay. Overall the managers only seem to care if you\xe2\x80\x99re dying or kissing their butts"
Amazon,1fdu06khu3od8001,4,"Good first job, but they keep workers disposable ",Grocery Associate,Overall it was okay. They cut everyone\xe2\x80\x99s hours during the pandemic and many people were forced to resign or just we\xe2\x80\x99re no longer scheduled. Pretty basic job.
Amazon,1fdtt5pdio2dr800,2,Fine,Warehouse Worker,"Good for beginners  to learn what work really is and show them what speed they need. It paid good, but after a while find another job that you like."
Amazon,1fdteq3iru38h802,1,If you value family don’t bother! ,Warehouse Worker,Terrible. Management is not helpful they time you on EVERYTHING YOU DO! you are just a number they care more about production then they do you! No work to life balance mandatory overtime! If you have young kids I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do I never saw them! It is a very physical job! 10 hour days! I lasted a year will never go back they do not respect you. They run it like a sweat shop it\xe2\x80\x99s even worse come Christmas time if you have family don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to see them! 
Amazon,1fdtdag5o3od8001,2,You are just a number ,Sortation Associate,"The only good thing about working here is the UPT/VTO system.You can get up to 80 hours of Unpaid Time Off per year, and it allows you to submit time to cover your shift so you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to traditionally call out and deal with the hassle. Aside from that, you are just another person working there that they can replace in a day. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter how long you\xe2\x80\x99ve been working there. All the managers care about is meeting the daily goals even if it means overworking the good employees while allowing lazy employees to do almost nothing. They show you very little appreciation and will abuse your work ethic at every opportunity."
Amazon,1fdtbv1103od8002,3,Something to pay the bills,Stow Associate,"If you need a quick job, this is it! Don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to advance and don\xe2\x80\x99t look for friends..high turnover rate, shady coworkers and management. Work can be boring and repetitive "
Amazon,1fdtbi6vjt4d3802,5,Customer service,Customer Service Representative,The job is flexible and allows me to have excellent work-life balance. The job allows me to set my own hours and use my skills to assist the customer.
Amazon,1fdtbcaj9o2dr802,4,Enjoyed working there management sucked.,Lead Problem Solver,Amazon was a good company to work for the set schedule I enjoyed.. peak season not so much.Eventually if your not taking care of yourself it will take a toll on your body. Pay was great raises every six months.. 
Amazon,1fdt6359gu38h801,4,Not bad to work at,Warehouse Associate,"The job can be difficult physically due to the weight of items, the great number of items needed to be carried and the speed at which you need to carry them.They did make an effort to have social event and they give free lunch at times."
Amazon,1fdt5sj26t4dh802,2,Not a good workplace,Inbound Stow Process assistant,"This job is not meant to have you stay there for more than a few months. Working at amazing can easily be incredibly hard on your body and you wont have much time to spend with family during the days you work. Management is constantly threatening to fire you/ demanding you work harder. You have to bend over backwards to get any sort of higher position from base level unless you seriously kiss butt. And if you are injured/ finally get sick of dealing with management kids your job goodbye because they will fight to deny you any compensation/send to their doctors and refuse to hear anything yours will say/do find a way to get you fired once you return back to work. Also 90% of over time is mandatory, regardless of what you say you can/can\xe2\x80\x99t do and you will be penalized if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t able to go to any mandatory overtime they throw on you."
Amazon,1fdt1h6gg3od8002,1,Sad and Draining ,Warehouse Worker,Amazon will over work you . Be mindful that the schedule of hours you have will place and impact on your body  10+ hours of standing on your feet doing the same job over and over with no time to sit or relax yes you get a break but 2 30 min breaks don\xe2\x80\x99t cut it for the pay 
Amazon,1fdt19setu38h802,3,productive,wherehouse worker,Management loves to play favorites. If you aren't one of the few chosen they don't care about you as long as the work is getting done. Safety is preached but not enforced.
Amazon,1fdsvqo86t4dh801,3,Strict but worth the money.,Order Fulfillment Associate,You can not breathe without permission and they give you 2 10 min breaks and a 30 min lunch. Amazon is such a big place that it takes 5 mins just to walk from your stations to the break room to sit down for 5 mins then you have leave. Almost every job on the floor is tedious and absolutely boring once you get the hang of it. But the pay was good.
Amazon,1fdsupfeku38h802,3,It's ok,Air,It's ok. It's so hot though. Those electrolyte drink additives they have are pretty great though. A lot of snot nosed rude punks work there sadly so that's a thing.
Amazon,1fdsqd2s6t4dh802,1,awful place,Warehouse Associate,"This work place was quite horrendous,i witnessed a few people collapse from exhaustion in my time here.Management was barely around at all.Covid was spreading like crazy."
Amazon,1fdsogpe53od8002,3,Could be worse,Sortation Center Associate,There's good and bad like everywhere else. The pay is decent but other places in the area pay more. The benefits are great. It's often incredibly frustrating working with lazy people or without the materials needed to do your job. 
Amazon,1fdsmqvi5o2dr802,3,"Competitive Pay, lots of walking, poor company",Material Handler,"Amazon pays fairly well. You will be doing 15-22 miles of walking a night, and as such you will begin to see yourself in shape. The HR system is a joke, and when amazon inevitably messes up your time off, or messes up your pay check you have to jump through hoops just to fix it. The time off policy is bad, and amazon hires far too many supervisors. Too many cooks. "
Amazon,1fdsl3kv6o2dr802,3,Coworkers are fun but overall its ok.,Transportation Specialist,Overall a good place to work. Coworkers are nice and getting the option to work from home is nice. Did not really like getting moved around a lot and switching teams. Management is ok but can be better.
Amazon,1fdskab1to2dr802,3,productive ,FC Associate I,nice place to work to save a check but they need to raise the pay. alot of work and some stress but i was always up for the task. stowing was my thing and if you pushed yourself you can ease your way up the ranks 
Amazon,1fdshh9jvu38h801,5,It's a job but gets repetitive. ,Process Assistant,The job was laid back. As a PA you are in charge of 20-50 AA's depending on your department. At the end of the day as long as your AA's are packing fast you will be ok. 
Amazon,1fdsgvgqq3od8000,4,Right manager for you is key,Team Manager,"Not bad as long as you apply yourself. However, be wary of getting a manager that does not line up with you. Amazon values employees in that it makes life easy for all but you can see that the bottom line is most important and it's a means to the end goal. If you do get leadership you don't align up with record everything and apply to other jobs in company. Your current manager is god for all intensive sake and if they like you you are gold, if they don't then you are out like trash. it's all their opinion and that's how the company will see you."
Amazon,1fdsfrpbau38h802,1,Management ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"Amazon only cares about their customers, they don\xe2\x80\x99t care about the workers at all worst job ever had the pay is not enough for that work place. It\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of favoritism as well"
Amazon,1fdseirlmt4d3801,5,Great place to get some good money but it's alot of standing and attitude but if you can ignore good place to work,wharehouse worker,I found the experience to be Good I don't like evthing is done from your phone but it was good place to learn and even move up if you stay long enough you could earn 
Amazon,1fdse549et4d3800,2,Slavery and Sadness,Warehouse Worker,"If you want to work long hours and short breaks in comparison to how large the facility is clocking out for lunch alone takes away majority of the lunch, struggle to even have time to get a bathroom break without managers writing you up then this job is for you. "
Amazon,1fdsdoht8u38h800,5,Easy work.,Stower,"Good place to work in, just do the same thing over and over. You get two 30 min breaks. No need to train everything is pretty basic and common sense. "

Amazon,1fds475evu38h802,3,The salary,Warehouse Associate,"Lock of managers support.  Constantly warnings for anything like not reaching their goal , for counting error, for missing items,  for going minutes arly to break or coming late from break having only 30 minutes you have to have long walks in order to have a place to seat ."
Amazon,1fdrppilgt4dh801,5,"Different shift days, you don’t have to work on the weekends.",Sortation Associate,Have ptos and upts just incase you need rest which you would obviously need usually. Fun environment and has lots of growth. Needs to pay more because the work becomes challenging at times.
Amazon,1fdrg4bq4o24r802,3,Physical work,MCO,Worked at delivery station had to stow and pick and stage all in one day. Very physically demanding had to lift bags that were 60lbs or heavier and push carts that were at least 200lbs at times. 
Amazon,1fdrenb52o2dr800,4,Productive and laid back,Warehouse Associate,Amazon was pretty easy to start in. The moment you walk in it is organized and they train you for 3 days in whatever department you land in it can be pretty random.
Amazon,1fdreauqet4d3802,1,Horrible company,Driver,They treat you like you're replaceable because you are. They give you inhuman workloads and expect you to be done on time every time. The do give benefits but that's the only good thing about this job. 
Amazon,1fdrcg9to3od8001,1,Internal vs external,Process Assistant,If you are trying to be promoted from within the company it is not worth the salary. Internals moving up get paid way less than external outside hires. Another thing is that amazon has a metric to meet on hiring external managers so even when there is spots open for internal promotions they won't allow it to ensure the external metric is met. I am leaving after 3 years of trying to move up because it is not worth the stress and pay. Another thing is that amazon loves to hire rude managers who only care about numbers not that we are people. It is very harsh to work in an environment where I get yelled at for drinking water after hard work.
Amazon,1fdrc1sl3o2dr800,4,"Good place to work at, but prepare for time changes (and a car).",Associate,"I was looking for a job that would keep me working while having the managers care about me. Amazon was the place I was looking for and did a good job training me and putting my safety first. It was not flawless however, as I personally lacked a car to get there as the CNO5 does not have very good public transportation options to and from there. Another problem is the constant flex ups (work an additional hour) due to poor management, which happened 90% of the time during my Twilight shifts. If you can manage those however, you can make the most out of it and possibly get promoted."
Amazon,1fdr527itt4dh801,3,Unfair,Associate,"There were long hours and mandatory overtime felt unfair. Easy to learn new things but moving up would be a little difficult. Pay was decent though; which, was only due to the night differential."
Amazon,1fdr06kf03od8002,2,Not sustainable long term,Jackpot/ Problem Solve Team,"Not sustainable long term. Goals become unrealistic if your a person who needs to drink water, eat lunch or use the bathroom in a 10-12 hour time span. The pay is great but the intentionally create conditions that promote high turnover. It\xe2\x80\x99s tempting but please find something else."
Amazon,1fdqvn29ro2dr801,3,Bearable ,AFE Packer,"No real sense of advancement unless you are closely connected to management in your personal life. Overall, they get feelings mixed in with work which becomes a mess. Pay and benefits are good but this job is only for a short term. "

Amazon,1fdqsvheft4dh802,3,Eh,ICQA Associate,Amazon is a good company. The Management is okay and works right along side of their employees. I'd say like anywhere the hard part of the job is dealing with standing for hours.
Amazon,1fdqnmt78t4d3800,3,Monotone work,T1 Blue Badge,"The work is monotone and is mentally numbing. You sit and take items from the belt to stack on pallets for 4 hour shifts. Cellphones when I worked were allowed but you were strongly discouraged from using them, it was a ""safety hazard."" The food in the cafeteria is overpriced and was rather bland. You expect the work but at my building it can suddenly have an influx because the Ops managers decided they were backed up, so suddenly enough packages to jam the line would come; That\'d be manageable if it weren\'t understaffed, but you could expect 6-8 T1 employees on a line meant for 18 people; That caused it to back up when the package load was heavy. Most employees either didn\'t meet scan rate or were skimping bye so you\'d be forced to pick up their slack or the line would blue light. That\'s when you\'d be given a ""verbal coaching."" There\'s basically no perks except Healthcare, Dental, and Vision; Which are good, but the ""other"" perk is $100 off any AMAZON item, did I make that clear? Only Amazon items got thaf discount, which were few and far between. There\'s no give or comprimise with Amazon, if you can\'t make it, you can\'t call out, you have to use the unpaid Time Off they alot you, which is only 20 hours every quarter of the year. They offer three types of employment, part time, Reduced time(32hr), and full time. However, be ready because they can flex you up as little as 20 minutes before the end of your shift and now you have to stay an hour later or use your time. The management doesn\'t care about you, because your a number and means to their fat bonuses. Oh, you thought"
Amazon,1fdqncdmh3od8002,1,boring af,Full Time Warehouse Associate,"you will not like it, it is the most boring job you will ever work in your life. shifts were 12 hours with 3 breaks. had to wear masks at all times unless at lunch in your confined little spot."
Amazon,1fdqn27b7o2dr801,3,You're here for the paycheck.,Warehouse Associate,"It's an alright place to work. I never felt like I was underpaid, but often felt overworked. Management is a rotating door; many of the employees last longer there than the upper management. There's zero job security; they'll take anybody, but if you can't perform your duties they'll replace you quickly and easily. They will move you around between jobs all over the facility, and advancement is a rat race.One good thing is they give you a lot of time off throughout the year and it's very flexible where and how you use it. If you want overtime, you've come to the right place. It's a job where you have to set your own goals. Use them like they use you. "
Amazon,1fdqhv2f9t4d3800,3,management and paid,unload the truck,"Always switch managers and PA, when they get in new position they have no experience and they don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to manage it. Always try to use over authority. Also people who work in trailer they should pay more.  "
Amazon,1fdqekq9so24r801,1,Fire happy,Warehouse Associate,"They terminate employees for no reason. They like terminating even if the employees are at good rate at the docks, benefits are good, pay was okay, your situation may vary."
Amazon,1fdqeebp7t4d3800,4,Productive fast paced,Process Assistant,Very strict especially covid. A lot of mandatory time per business need. Work most holidays closed Christmas and half day thanksgiving. On your feet a lot. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard work 
Amazon,1fdqbomeet4d3800,2,Den of Lies,Amazon Warehouse Associate,When you apply for Amazon remove the idea of being able to slide into a role you enjoy. 9 out of 10 times you will not be placed in a good role. Best chances are jumping into a facility that just opened. Yet the older the location the harder it is to advance. Before I came people were able to move department to department without issue. Now it's if you're there they don't want you transferring unless you are at least 4-6 months old. The awful part is the app says 30 days of employment to transfer. It's a lie it's really a minimum of 60 at most locations. They don't care about your health more of your injuries will happen on the job. That's why they offer health insurance on day one! This job is great for those who are looking for a quick check weekly and don't mind breaking the body in the process. Or for those who are able to find a loophole in this mess to advance. Once you are on top (Black/Blue vest not yellow) you have the ability to enjoy the place. Other than that you have to find your peace in this chaos 
Amazon,1fdqb0osto2dr800,2,Stable but not fun,Processor,"There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of micromanaging at Amazon. I started working there due to COVID, I needed a stable job which I got. But they move you around in different departments, youre over worked while the pay is not worth it. A lot of the woman working there are rude "
Amazon,1fdqa42nn3od8002,5,No brainer job,Warehouse Worker,"Working as a warehouse worker at amazon was a pretty decent gig. You may dress how you want, you dont have to talk to anyone, all the work is on you. No BS job. It was pretty easy and it was just straight physical labor. Come in, do your job, and leave. VTO made it easy to balance work and life. Great sidejob or job for high schoolers or anyone looking for an extra few bucks. Pay was not bad either. "
Amazon,1fdq9n1obt4d3800,1,Stressful company,Customer Advocacy Leader,"Great onboarding, great culture on training but then reality hit. Anxiety, stress, pressure, KPI's, performance!!! Honestly it's so mich better  to remain an Amazon customer rather than an employee."

Amazon,1fdq2df0v3od8000,2,Unorganized ,Picker/Packer,Very unorganized and no room to advance. You are constantly on your feet and you barley see team leads or management. Your kinda thrown into your job but the pay during peak is nice 
Amazon,1fdq18edm3od8000,1,Horrible,Associate,"This is a job that u work while looking for another job. Honestly, its terrible. Standing for 10 hours, expected to work at top speed for entire shift. And 12 hours mandatory time is the new standard for mandatory days. If u don't make rates, u will be written up and eventually fired. If u go to the bathroom too much, u will be written up and fired. U are a number, nothing more. "
Amazon,1fdpukmbkt4dh801,1,Fresh association ,Fresh Associate,Listen this is not a job that you want to work at and the reasons are it is very fast pace and your back will hurt and the benefits are pretty much non existed to at this point. I will never work here again
Amazon,1fdpu2462u38h800,1,Modern day slavery,Returns Processor,It\xe2\x80\x99s all about numbers there. Time off task (TOT) is ridiculous. It was overall terrible. The only thing that kept me going was some of the people I worked with.
Amazon,1fdptosueu38h802,4,Overall it’s a good job and good working environment.,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"It\xe2\x80\x99s good if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a job that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require a lot of work. The working environment is okay. People don\xe2\x80\x99t really talk, everyone just tries to get their work done."
Amazon,1fdprjkvot4d3800,1,Being apart of amazon dsp is the worst job ive ever had,Delivery Driver/ part time dispatcher,No one supports you zero family time eating dinner at 9:30pm at night. Zero sense of routing pay is terrible for what they ask. No where to go to the bathroom and to find a place takes time off route. Which they email the company and ask why we stop so long. Work through lunch overall terrible job and would never recommend
Amazon,1fdpq6lu4o2dr802,3,I love amazon,Process Assistant,it's great I love to work at amazon people are cool and you get points to redeem for t shirts.  When talking to managers make sure you have proof of each conversation its best to text. Don't expect to eat Or use the restroom comfortably you only receive two 15 minute breaks A-day.
Amazon,1fdposjnpu38h801,2,Tough,Amazon Warehouse Associate,A LOT not for someone who is lazy but the work load is insane and by the time you walk down the mile long hallway fot break its time to go back       
Amazon,1fdpk766t3od8001,3,The jobs boring as ever.,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"The job is okay, it's really just good because of the flexible schedules you can choose from. Everything else could be waaay better and definitely needs work."
Amazon,1fdphv7p53od8000,3,Hard work ,Warehouse Worker,"The job has a nice pay rate as it went up to almost $20 an hour but it depends on your position. It requires hard work and standing on your feet for a max. Of 10 hrs, I would consider Amazon as part time job or if you want to make extra cash. "
Amazon,1fdp0b0kku38h801,3,Good but not great.,Learning Ambassador/picker/counter/icqa/pg,Working at amazon has its benefits and definitely gives you a chance to use pto/upt to your advantage. 2 30 minute breaks for a 10 hour shift 4 days a week. Second break is pretty bad depending on how far you're stationed (how long it takes you to walk to break room/car counts towards you break). Management can be great at times but it has a high turnover even for management positions. Place can go from being really good one month to terrible the next. It's a good short term job to get some hustle/experience in with some decent pay. 
Amazon,1fdop72303od8001,3,No career growth.,Customer Service Representative,"Once in customer service, always in customer service. You can\'t move from customer service department to other departments. Secondly, No pay raises. I\'ve worked there for 6 years now, my salary has been the same since. I love the flexibility to work from home though. Plus, aside the poor pay, poor management and poor career progression opportunities. We are celebrated as a ""team"". Some things are good, some are bad so its a 50/50. "
Amazon,1fdol14s33od8001,3, Amazon,Stower/Picker,         It could be a whole lot better. The pay is minimal. The managers arent the best. They are unorganized and treat you like slaves for the most part. And their way of speaking to you is disrespectful. The benifits are good tho

Amazon,1fdogacndnpl7802,4,It’s whatever,FC Associate/ MEZ,"It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too bad, it just get super boring and repetitive after the first month, some of the people seemed sus but most were really cool, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really much advancement made know so it felt like a dead end job"
Amazon,1fdocig61s7l5802,3,Great Job If Physically Fit,Sortation Associate,"Great company to work for us physically fit. Pay was ok, but I still wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go back even though the pay has increased because it can be physically draining."
Amazon,1fdo94ij6u29d800,3,Productive but not its best,Amazon Associate,Management is super controlling. You have to keep everything documented or you could get written up easily. I got promoted within tier one but I don't see a future there much longer. 
Amazon,1fdo24jbqu29d802,3,I would have given 5 stars when I first started... now I know,Customer Service Agent,"The job itself, customer service representative, has its pros and cons as you can imagine.  Amazon really does try to be in their words, ""customer-centric"".  The problem is that they are not ""employee-centric"".  Employees are constantly stressed by productivity reports that are not completely accurate and employees that do follow policy are often in danger of bad reviews by customers because of not just giving in to the customer which in turn affects the employees productivity reports.  Minimum wage is great but there are no raises after that without being promoted and being promoted is nearly impossible."
Amazon,1fdnrt7d5u23m800,3,"For a picker, you do ALOT of walking....",Picker,"They don\'t give you enough time to get to your stops before the machine timer runs out and I\'m told they have a quota that is expected but I\'m not worrying about the quota. I work for quality, not quantity.... but that\'s just me. They do allow you to order one free pair of ""company approved"" shoes \'for safety\' but they are guaranteed for returns if not satisfied. Bad culture there. Had problems with being accepted to go to work. Once in, training didn\'t take long before going to work. "
Amazon,1fdnr96qcnpl7802,1,"A lot of hours,  thankless job",Fufillment Associate,"You work like a machine non stop. There isn't really any help offered by management . Breaks are not on time, and hardly able to take lunch on time. Would not recommend "
Amazon,1fdnl062ku29d801,2,Management ,Picker,I have worked at Amazon for two summers and have yet to meet my supervisor. I have never be told where to go if I had a problem. Training & communication could be greatly improved!!
Amazon,1fdnahjegu29d801,1,Bad management ,Package Handler,Really bad management and organization. Bad pay. Really unorganized routes back and forth to places you were already at. Too many rules about how you drive. Not allowed to back up at all or you get point off. Very bad place to work. Only work here If you're desperate. 
Amazon,1fdn8be77u29d802,3,its okay,Associate,"I used to work at a amazon warehouse for three years and I loved it, but our building got shut down recently. I transferred to a fresh location and I honestly do not like it. They barely train you and expect you to get everything by your first day "
Amazon,1fdn820eknq1d800,2,Management and HR are difficult to deal with on a daily basis,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Job is okay and many of my coworkers were great.  Management and HR are terrible in general.  Most managers are hired right out of college with no job expierence.  
Amazon,1fdmpau5su23m800,5,Overall a good place to work,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"In my case I have moved up to a learning ambassador but once I became an ambassador they wouldn't teach me anything new once they have someone in that specific place they really don't want to put anyone new there, so that's why I got rid of my blue vest and just became a regular vest because they wouldn't teach me anything and I'm the type of person who wants to learn new things so other than that Amazon is a good place to work if you want to do the same thing but if you ever want to learn something new you just have to keep asking and you have to really show that you want to learn a new skill."
Amazon,1fdmlppg0u23m802,3,Amazon ,Pg,Needs to pay more money because you do a lot of work and they make so much. They expect you to move like robots and they also have a lot of lazy people and they make you pick up their slack
Amazon,1fdmidr2fnpl7802,3,"Productions rates, revolving door employment structure, moving freight, and useless management It's work... what can I say. ",Ramp Agent,"Favoritism, and a lack of proper recognition for the ones who truly deserve it. False narratives projecting the chance for growth and development that are merely meant to keep to compliant just long enough till your replacement arrives. Often falling short of their commitments to employees, whether it be on time you can leave, or jobs/responsibilities you may take on at your site. Promising one thing, then delivering the other while smiling all the same. You'll move boxes, and you WILL have people hounding you to do more of what you already are doing. A comically oppressive culture using family as a guise to milk what they can of employees, while sending them to breaks late and failing to train them properly to ensure their safety. The entire warehouse structure is disappointing."
Amazon,1fdme96n0nq1d801,3,Can never get used to it,Warehouse Associate,"My shift starts at 3:20 am, which is super early for someone wanting to work a 9am-5pm job. However, if you are willing to wake up that early it might be for you. On the plus side, you come home while the sun is still up and you can do whatever errands you need to do once you are done with work, its just for me I can never get use to this schedule. As far as compensation and benefits, it is the typical large corporation benefits with some additional stocks that you can purchase. However, I think the pay could be better because you are doing physical labor after all. Nonetheless the pay is ok and you can get by if you are good with saving money because the pay is weekly unlike the regular bi-weekly that most people that have work are used to. As far as job security, I have yet to see a blue badge get let go. Maybe in really tough situations where this blue badge messed up pretty badly. Moving on to job advancement, it is pretty hard to advance in Amazon regardless of what they post on the A to Z app sharing stories of people who have moved up. You have to be chummy with every manager that there is in the warehouse you work for or else you wouldn't move up in the ranks because those managers are the ones that talk to each other and decide whether they give you a pass to go up or you don't. The management differs from warehouse to warehouse it just depends how the station manager runs it. If the station manager is hands on and likes to micromanage, the you are going to be in a very toxic environment, but if your station manager is relaxed about every and let every employee under"
Amazon,1fdm5dof3u23m800,3,Ok place to work,wearhouse associate,"Easy job that Used to be a great & fun place to work. high turnover rate & overly micromanaged, bunch of mangers not knowing what they are doing. The job is really what you make it pay doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match work expected "
Amazon,1fdlrpefasa4h800,5,Awesome people and enthusiastic.,Quality Assurance Auditor,I loved working for Amazon. They have a strict attendance policy and will terminate employees for negative unpaid time. Management is awesome. HR is very reliable. The company genuinely care about the mental health of associates. Over all excellent experience.
Amazon,1fdlobfo7npl7800,4,Good place to work ,Fulfillment Associate,Great benefits. Good pay. The ability to move up must be willing to work any schedule. Also good people to work with. Must be willing to adjust to the shift work. 
Amazon,1fdlo0634npl7801,4,Productive and fun workplace ,Picker,Great place to work. Pay was pretty good especially during peak season although it was very busy. Time went by quick. Raffles were a nice way to reward hard work.
Amazon,1fdlnpk78npl7800,5,Easy and rewarding ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Very easy job does get a little old constantly doing the exacts same thing over and over but not impossible. One thing that was a little annoying was 30 minute lunches but some like that
Amazon,1fdllahgknpl7800,1,"Amazon - WORK HARD, have (little) fun, Make HISTOR(ical profits for top brass)",Area Manager,"Basically this place will squeeze the life out of you. You can kiss you friends, family, and energy goodbye.

Amazon,1fdli11s5u29d802,4,Good pay,Customer Returns,I work for Amazon in Aberdeen Maryland. The warehouse is nice and clean and the work is easy. The pay is pretty good compared to most other places in the area. 
Amazon,1fdlhbnjgu23m800,2,If cool for a short time,"Problem Solver, picker, packer","Don\xe2\x80\x99t stay long. They try to write you up for a lot of small things and even if you can bridge a lot of it, they will still write you up . Majority of the managers don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything and are inexperienced so they know little compared to the regular aa\xe2\x80\x99s. But they love to act like they know what they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. And they set unrealistic standards for certain areas and departments. "
Amazon,1fdlaem8js7l5800,4,Good place to work,Fullfillment Associate,Coworkers makes it easy and bearable to work. Learned new skills. Willingness to help you move around for growth opportunities and to learn new skills.
Amazon,1fdl00038u29d802,3,It’s ok ,logistics/Quality associate,Working at amazon is not to bad just be prepared to work also management isn\xe2\x80\x99t to good depending on location but they do have great ones \xe2\x80\xbc\xef\xb8\x8f Also they like to have favorites or as I call them \xe2\x80\x9c do boys \xe2\x80\x9c that the move up fast but there is job security and the work is explanatory. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a longtime career job only If you move up so have a exit strategy . Also co workers are an A+ they are the only motivation honestly . Pay NEEDS TO BE MORE like 15$ with no covid hazard pay is ridiculous pay should be 17 to 18$ ATLEAST . Oh yeah my station plays music out loud with the option to request songs throughout the whole shift so that\xe2\x80\x99s great honestly . 
Amazon,1fdkrvp1au29d800,3,Okay place to work temporarily ,Warehouse Worker,"More suited for younger people. Physically hard on your body. If you\xe2\x80\x99re good in your position you will never get a chance to learn other areas, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be stuck doing the same thing. "
Amazon,1fdkm2hc2npl7800,2,"Fast-paced environment, simple job",Warehouse Associate,"This was a simple job, but I ultimately left because they hired too many people and the warehouse became very crowded and messy. It would have been better if they had a bigger warehouse."

Amazon,1fdkink9ou23m802,5,Job,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,I love my job they helped grow me as a person at amazon its a great place to work lots of opportunity to move up best job IV had will stay till retirement
Amazon,1fdkh5d4bs7l5802,5,Great pay just a lot of walking ,Amazon Warehouse Worker,This is a great easy job that pays you really good. The only bad part is it\xe2\x80\x99s boring and a lot of walking. There are also goood benefits for people that want that.
Amazon,1fdkdikdju29d801,3,The delivery station ,Amazon Warehouse Associate,Working at a delivery station is great! The hours aren't flexible its over night 4\xc3\x9710s 1am to 1135am. Always room to move up and learn new things if that what you want. Starting at a brand new facility makes it easier for you to move up. The work is fast paced and physical. There are alot of managers with different personalities some micromanage some let you do your thing. Great benefits with stock purchase option 401k 4% match. Amazon is so diverse the celebrate everything from juneteeth to Christmas which is nice. 
Amazon,1fdkapp6rs7l5802,2,Decent job but poor HR and management ,Associate,During my time here the best part was the other associates. HR does nothing to help associate nor do they listen to what we have to say even when it has to do with potential harassment issues. Management could be better they lack a bit of communication towards the associates. Wrap down gets no love and to make it worse they lie about the hours we will work. It said 4 hour shifts but they kept numbing it down to 3.
Amazon,1fdk7eb3vnpl7802,3,Great co-workers and mostly chill managers,Associate,"Was an associate at the warehouse in Irvine, but as part of the VET group. Flexible hours, but hard to pick up shifts as it's 1st come 1st serve. They mostly phased it out now. Most managers were nice and understanding, work was fast paced. Unless you're scanning, it's hard for them to know who is actually working hard and who is taking it easy and relying on others to pick up the slack."
Amazon,1fdk3jr4su29d802,3,"Amazon Prime Now Associate, was an ok job for the pay. But repetitive ",Prime Now Associate,Very repetitive and physical job but not more physical than at a larger warehouse i assume.Got 2 15 min breaks and 1 lunch for working a 5 hour shift.I had to choose my own hours
Amazon,1fdk2ia5eu29d800,2,Management harassment!,Stower,"Management and AP's were very rude to you and very disrespectful towards you. If you had questions about anything they were not knowledgeable. They would nick pick and tried to bully you, they were very unprofessional, and this is at the fulfillment center in Bessemer Alabama.. they were the main reason I left Amazon because they created a hostile environment. The harassment from management  and AP'S were too much!!! But pay and benefits were excellent!"
Amazon,1fdjt838fnq1d802,3,Not sure what to expect!,Stower,"HR is a joke! Can't talk to anyone! The management is pretty good easy to talk to and ask questions, they seem like they really want you to excel. The break rooms are nice and you get adequate brakes."
Amazon,1fdjmu6pds7l5802,2,"Long, tedious and boring.",Amazon Warehouse Associate,"If you\xe2\x80\x99re a robot that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind moving for 10 hours a shift, doing nothing but putting boxes away, putting stuff in a bag, being in a room below freezing for at least 2 hours, and working in silence the entire time with no headphones and barely any social interaction, then this job is for you. You\xe2\x80\x99re also timed and must meet quotas that\xe2\x80\x99re near impossible."
Amazon,1fdjlglg7nq1d802,2,Not the greatest,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Always a rotating door with management and employees. Not a stable job for hours at all. They tend to only promote people outside the company that have no sense of what its like to work in a warehouse. It is a very flexible job that you wont be able to find anywhere else if thats what your looking for. The work life is easy but demoralizing and repetitive. If your looking to get a paycheck every week then thats a plus. 
Amazon,1fdji8cjds7l5800,5,Great job,Customer Returns Processor,Love the job great benefits great people great hours easy hire on process and geeat supervisors good pay amazing company would definitely work there again

Amazon,1fdiqkoi6s7l5802,2,Job Description,Tier 1 Associate,"Work inside an Amazon warehouse, selecting, packing and shipping customer orders. If you like a fast-paced, physical position that gets you up and moving, then come help bring orders to life. Work a set, full-time schedule. Shift options include overnight and days, and usually at least one weekend day. Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s delivery stations are the final stop before an order heads out for delivery to the customer\xe2\x80\x99s door. In this active job you sort packages into delivery routes. To ensure we meet customer-promised delivery times, shift times will vary. Depending on your location, you\xe2\x80\x99ll work a set schedule with hours that range between full-time and part-time.Would not recommend! stressful without reason. Managers suck and don't listen to associates who have been there years. Area Managers micro manage and kiss a^^ to the higher ups. Don't get on managements bad side they will want to see you not succeed based on personal opinions against you. Favoritism at its best. Unqualified college graduates will be picked over you to be management when you've been there a long time. No room to grow. Work is not meaningful and mandatory over time sucks. Hard to work here with a family."
Amazon,1fdio3auvnpl7802,4,Delivery Driving is physically demanding,Delivery Driver,"You need to be in good shape to do the job; a lot of moving in and out of the vans, a lot of carring (sometimes really heavy items). Patience is important; sometimes you come accross some confusing delivery where you need to call the customers directly for instructions. Amazon supervisors don't like drivers bringing back packages...your delivery supervisors would be your go to for any issues and they are helpful."
Amazon,1fdilmncos7l5802,3,It pay 2 dollars above the minimum wage ,wearhouse associate,"The pay rate is decent but you will have to do 1 extra day of work to get a above average cheek. The manager are stuck up, rude and o my thank of their  self. You find a few management that actually care about your well being. The don\xe2\x80\x99t prioritize your health, they focus on the job at hand even if it mean breaking your body to your limits"

Only people they like move up. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the hardest worker or the person showing the most promise. It\xe2\x80\x99s about knowing the right people or brown nosing the right people. I got lucky and knew the right people. HR also tends to hide from people in the office. I waited in there for 15-20 minutes waiting for someone to come out. They eventually did but it\xe2\x80\x99s like they wait to see if you leave "

Amazon,1fdibveu2u23m801,3,Skip it,Warehouse Worker,If your looking to advance your career look elsewhere. You do not get paid for your productivity so everyone sits around not working and doing the very least they can. If you enjoy being lazy this is the place for you so you can blend in and just be a number.
Amazon,1fdi8crouu23m801,1,Long Shifts,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Benefits are great usually a decent work environment but hours are long and not really flexible once you pick a schedule it\xe2\x80\x99s like you\xe2\x80\x99re stuck.      
Amazon,1fdi6q9ugs7l5802,2,Overall not horrible first job ,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"They constantly gave free stuff, foods and snacks which was a nice plus but overall it was stressful and constantly moving for 10 hours. The best part was the free stuff and worse was the fo workers."
Amazon,1fdi5cj4enpl7802,3,It gets the bills paid,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"To preface, I worked at the DS (delivery station) not the FC (fulfillment center).It\xe2\x80\x99s a very strenuous job. You do get used to it after a couple weeks to a month depending on how active you are. Guaranteed, you\xe2\x80\x99ll lose weight and gain muscle. It\xe2\x80\x99s not far off when some people consider it like exercise but it only feels like that on a low volume day. Otherwise, the workload is more overbearing on the body and just feels miserable. Really understand that you have to handle and carry the weight maximum many times during the day! You\xe2\x80\x99re on your feet for most or all of the shift. Breaks and lunch might not feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s enough at times to recuperate. The roles and jobs there are pretty easy to understand. Some things might be tougher to do in practice as the shift goes pretty fast. If the head count\xe2\x80\x99s there though it should go smoothly. If not, it can be a bit pressing and exhausting to work.The work environment was real chill for a good chunk of the time I was there. Sometimes there was drama, sometimes high volume days saw agitated people, other times poor management and shift decisions affected how your day was. It happens unfortunately. It\xe2\x80\x99s sort of easy to move up, however, some favoritism can be seen. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to transfer in case you do get plateaued at any point in the moving up process, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a personal decision."
Amazon,1fdi4snr2nq1d800,5,great place to work,Team Member,great place to work if you work and respect people to should have a good career and if you want to move up you just have to hustle and work hard and you will be fine

Amazon,1fdhrc657u23m802,1,Feels like slavery.,Warehouse Associate,"They don\xe2\x80\x99t really care about the associates only numbers. They have a system with Unpaid Time that you can use if you can\xe2\x80\x99t make it to work, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of like PTO but no pay. If your Unpaid time balance gets low, HR can manipulate and make balance go negative which results in termination. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it happen."
Amazon,1fdhplcbks7l5802,3,Not a great place to be.,FC Associate,I felt overworked and underpaid. The management team was not helpful in solving a lot of my issues. It gave reach your goal and if you can't you don't matter.
Amazon,1fdhpa0gqu29d800,4,No that godd,Fresh Associate,Don\xe2\x80\x99t work here unless you prepped for the physical nature of this job because they will push you and give you no medical help in regards to injuries 
Amazon,1fdhgra8lsa4h801,4,"Poor work-life balance, without fair compensation",Area Manager,"Given offer for management position, 40-hours per week salary.  Actually work 50-70 hours, NEVER paid overtime.  T1 associates below me make more per hour than I do.  Not fairly compensated for the value and hard work brought to the company."
Amazon,1fdgvjn42u23m802,5,Productive and fun place to work with ,Fulfillment Associate,Good job to work for Received products using radio frequency scanners and relocated products using powered-equipment.Picked customer orders on all level of a multi-level mezzanine. Packed and shipped customers' orders.Received products and troubleshooted problems to resolution.
Amazon,1fdgv01iju29d802,4,Amazon,Sortation Associate,Amazon is a good place to work at. They are very flexible with there schedule. The only thing I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like was they were very unorganized when it came down to work task
Amazon,1fdgq6ojqu23m802,4,Good pay but a lot of drama ,Warehouse Worker,Amazon is a good company to work for but the shifts are long. However the pay is great compared to other companies. The employees click up and gossip about everybody. Besides that I do recommend 8/10
Amazon,1fdgnbm2ru29d801,2,Nice pay ,Sortation worker ,Really nice pay for entry level job. Hard on the body. But overal I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s a nice place to work to get a decent living. I like that you can use an app to communicate with your job site and see your schedule. 
Amazon,1fdgn5o6tnpl7801,3,Productive and paychecks can be good,Warehouse Associate,"Overall the company is good if you\xe2\x80\x99re at a point in life where you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to keep busy and make a decent paycheck for the time being. And you\xe2\x80\x99ve got your youth. Paychecks are nice during peak season but you will work insane hours. No work, life balance. I made some great friendships here. Management is all over the place and turnover rate seems just as high for them as employers. Seemed like you had 5-6 managers to report to on any given shift. "
Amazon,1fdglculfu23m802,5,Good workplace,Scanner/Sorter,It is an amazing and growing company. There was  only night shifts when I got in. I was moved to scanner on the first day. Warehouse was tiring and hot.
Amazon,1fdgl4hous7l5800,4,Good job. Good Benifits.,Associate,Average work experience. Very active work environment. Communication could be a little better. Training in certain positions could be longer. Over all a good job. Would recommend to other job seekers.
Amazon,1fdgiji6au23m802,4,Great Benefits,Warehouse Inventory Associate,Not a bad place to work. Worked there for a year and nothing major happened with management. Would recommend anyone to work there. Be flexible things do change and are different at each site.
Amazon,1fdgh3ulos7l5801,3,It's alright,FC Associate I,"The pay is pretty decent and you can pick up other shifts if you want to make more, but it's a very physical job. The management seems to want to pressure you to do better or just not be there at all. My main issue is their response to Covid and how they don't seem to enforce the 6 feet rule, which is somewhat understandable given the environment. Is a good place to work if you can keep up the pace."
Amazon,1fdgg9rkcnpl7801,4,Great part-time gig during college,Warehouse Associate,"The very flexible work hours and understanding staff make this a great place to work at as a college student. The benefits starting out aren't great. However, I was able to take time off without affecting my available PTO for a school related activity. Advancement to full time makes this also a reliable job to start out. However there is A LOT of physical activity. It didn't tire me out (I'm average in fitness, was never an athlete), but some parts can get heavy."
Amazon,1fdgcl6vhu29d802,1,Toxic,Technical Account Management III,Absolute toxic environment to work in. The office was full of people that all have known each other for a very long time as it was in a small town. Their way or fired. If they don't like you or you make them mad then fired. And this firing of employees is encouraged at Amazon as there was/is a certain percentage of people every year they need to cull from the herd. This doesn't mix well with the small cliques of leadership and people that come in to work from outside it. I saw people get fired over insignificant performance metrics only for those metrics to change in a few months to find ways to fire more. Several employees are sick and mentally checked out with a few in my time there being fired from having mental breakdowns and being on physician mandated leave from it. I was eventually let go after a medical leave for not being a good fit for the amazon culture. This was after 2 years of no raise and no reason as to why it wasn't given (was in policy to give reason and was ignored). Stay away from Amazon at all costs and you will be better off long term in both mental and physical health.
Amazon,1fdgbobetnq1d802,3,Ship dock worker,Warehouse Associate,"You work for your money. Shift supervisor was rude and played favorites. Nice perks during peak season, especially if you are hitting a our quota for the day."
Amazon,1fdg6pg60nq1d800,2,Poor Management ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"Every job is different every location is different. Ive heard good and bad from amazon, unfortunately i had the bad end. Horrible manager reported an incident and HR never did anything. If you can handle a job and work its an easy place, if you know what youre going in for especially, if you are just there to make money for a bigger purpose go ahead but keep that in mind always! "
Amazon,1fdg5c5e9u29d800,3,"Takes care of you, also breaks you down",Social Distancing Process Assistant - Tier 3,"Benefits are great, full coverage insurance very very affordable for my entire family. (Self, wife and two kids) Pay is fair for warehouse work. Very repetitive and easy. Amazon teaches you EXACTLY what to do and it\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to fail at your job. If you aren\xe2\x80\x99t lazy then you\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine"
Amazon,1fdg15c1pu23m802,2,Hard work for mediocre pay with no future,Delivery Associate,"Worked as delivery associate for 3 months, which is probably longer than most as burnout is pretty high. Job is demanding, stressful, and ultimately doesn't lead anywhere for most. They constantly have fresh bodies coming in so there never too concerned with treating their workers right to keep them from leaving. Ultimately, the job is good for if you need the money and want to start working asap, but not something you want to be doing for more than a few months/a year. Most drivers were angling to build up a resume to work for some of the better carriers (Fedex, ups, etc.) or just biding time till they found something else. "
Amazon,1fdfvpqnbnq1d801,1,The Best Technology to Exploit Workers,Associate Production,Workers are disposable. Working without soul and focus in productivity. You always have to be a good worker everyday. Very stressful environment to work.
Amazon,1fdftfa58s7l5801,1,Bad place to work,Stower,I would not recommend this job to anybody that has a choice to get another job. After a while you are going to be tired of standing on your feet and the pay isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth my mental health.
Amazon,1fdft9k3inq1d800,2,Overly complicated slave labor,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"People who worked there were cool, the work was not too hard, but the whole system sucked basically designed to move through people at a rapid pace. management were not the best people for the job but some were pretty good. However i would not recommend a job unless you get into its upper levels as they have way more job security.  "
Amazon,1fdfrmftcnq1d801,1,It beats being unemployed.,Warehouse Associate,"You're just a body until Amazon build robots well enough to replace you. The pay is poor, very physical, work/life balance is poor if you're in a relationship. If you need temporary income and immediate benefits, take the job, but have an exit plan or they'll work you until you're 6ft deep."
Amazon,1fdfqnf51u29d801,1,Just a job ,Warehouse Associate,"Pays decent.  It's ok for short term goals.  Entry level positions.  Fairly easy just physically demanding.  Environment is solitary, antisocial.  Not really inclusive or motivational in encouraging job growth or new skills"
Amazon,1fdfos00ss7l5802,5,Really average but good,Associate,"In my personal experience, the job was easy, my co-workers were good, and we work as a team, the only thing is that the manager has their preference with certain people just because they flattered him a lot."
Amazon,1fdfkrep4nq1d802,5,Productive fun place to work ,Safety Lead,I met a lot of amazing people. It was very easy using p t o time. It was good for being late due to traffic. The managers are very nice and understanding. 
Amazon,1fdfjq08gsa4h800,5,fair and professional workplace,manager,My experience is positive at this workplace and I recommended it because it is a professional and honest environment. I had a great experience and gain so much knowledge.
Amazon,1fdfhiogsu23m802,5,Fast paced and productive work environment ,Stower,Amazon is a good job. The work is not too bad. It might be a lot of walking but overall the process is pretty smooth. Plus you have water stations on every corner. 
Amazon,1fdfg92bsu29d802,3,Your welcome Jeff Bezos,Warehouse Associate,I have had a few different jobs in my life. The time I spent working for amazon wasn't the best but it wasn't the worse.  Overall the work wasn't hard at all and they had systems in place to make sure you weren't working 24/7. PTO was gained fairly quickly and Vacation days didn't take to terribly long to accrue either.  Everybody there can be kind of fun to work with.  The downside... the pay is horrible. and management doesn't have any idea what they're doing so you end up with this whole your not sure whose in charge every day thing.  
Amazon,1fdfedf76s7l5802,4,Productive ,ICQA Associate,Overall a good place to work at. Many different programs available once you hit your one year mark. You will be required to walk a lot of miles per day. 
Amazon,1fdfcl428u29d800,5,By far the best place I have ever worked,Operations Manager,"I wish I would have found Amazon sooner in my life.  It is by far the best place I have ever worked.  It's hard.  The learning curve is steep.  The days are long.  But...if you are driven by a competitive nature, this is the place.  It is so much fun managing the flow through the building and making sure everything gets done to deliver the commitment to the customers.  Driving safety and employee engagement....improving the building....thinking about what's next in your career.  It all comes together and creates and extremely fulfilling work environment.  Benefits are the best you can get.  Compensation is generous.  Three days off per week most of the year.  Constant change management and helping folks adjust.  Somewhat political environment when it comes time to evaluate the management crew for sure.  Make sure you are on the right side of the leadership team and you'll do fine.  Mid level leaders change often....mostly due to promotions or moving to another job they want to try out.  I have had 4 bosses in one year.  Still....I love it and can't wait to get to work every day."
Amazon,1fdf9kr8ts7l5801,3,They expect a lot for little pay,Customer Service Representative,"amazon is stingy and disrespectful of its employees. I was rerated constantly by customers and management was just a fluffy representative that didn\'t help but ""encouraged"" ."
Amazon,1fdf51h0ju23m800,1,They'll eventually take your shift away,Trainer,"I worked for Amazon for nearly a decade. They'll take your shift away at some point, move you to a different shift and won't really care if you can't work the hours. Pros and cons depend entirely on what building you work in."
Amazon,1fdeuisdnu23m802,3,Overworked ,Picker,"I work as a picker there, and it is tiring work. Shifts are 10-12 hours with one hour break split into 2- 30 min separate breaks. If you work 12hrs you get one last 15 min break. Working overnights and on the weekends you get a shift differential pay of 2.50 extra on top of base pay, which is nice. 12hr shift is too long and it\xe2\x80\x99s physical work. You do get paid weekly, and can use the pto, vacation you accrue when you want. But with that in mind you have to manage it wisely, ex. Covering the time you come in late, or have to leave early. You have to work one mandatory OT shift in a week when needed. Overall I would have stayed if pay was kept the same for day time for less hours. Turn over is very high so a lot of management don\xe2\x80\x99t bother to introduce themselves. "
Amazon,1fdehbedhnpl7802,1,I rather be unemployed,Cloud Support Engineer,"It's Amazon. Corporate or warehouse, it's definitely a place that hires to fires with a really archaic, combative, and hostile workplace. Recruiters are so desperate that they are constantly reaching out just to fill roles because people are quitting in droves."
Amazon,1fdechmp9sa4h800,3,Run of the mill warehouse job,Warehouse Worker,"Basic warehouse job. Spent lots of time picking stuff up and putting it into place. Was called in early during some days, and had to stay late on others. The company is alright, but its nothing special."
Amazon,1fdeahn39nq1d802,2,bad,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,dont recommend it was  awful place to work at and i was there for 7 months. you just a number that can easily be replaced just like any other job. trust me
Amazon,1fdea66u1u23m802,5,Best Place to work at ,Quality Team Leader,Best place to work at. Good pay and benefits. Best locations are the ones in Hazel Park and Romulus (Hannan Rd). Management is very friendly. You won\xe2\x80\x99t regret it.
Amazon,1fde38i5mu29d802,1,Endless work,Problem Solver,"You can be the most efficient worker, never miss a day, go with the flow. Yet not feel any advancement, even packing 300-400 jobs/HR. 10 hour shift minimum, if that's for you then enjoy."
Amazon,1fde1s1vds7l5801,5,Productive and fast paced environment ,Warehouse Worker,"I worked there over the summer and it was good. Pay is good, especially with overtime. I did not mind the 12 hours shifts but that maybe too mich for some."
Amazon,1fde16vmnnq1d800,4,Good,Picker/Packer,It is a good job with decent pay and benefits. It is busy and keeps you busy. I would recommend this jobs if you need good pay and want to have proper benefits 
Amazon,1fdduevqiu23m800,1,Not Good,Picker,"Amazon is not a good place to work. There is no opportunity to grow, the hours are long and the labor is difficult. It's hard to make rate. Only good thing about amazon is shopping on amazon.com"
Amazon,1fddn4jrss7l5802,4,Manager,Problem Solver,"Manager was rude. Good benefits, at first I had awesome management, very helpful & helped me move up quick. That was short lived with new management. "
Amazon,1fddlnd7pu23m801,2,Don’t work here,Fulfillment Associate,"Not sure about other positions, but warehouse treats employees like robots. Definitely not worth the pay, or even the sign-on bonus. Don\xe2\x80\x99t kill your body for such low pay."
Amazon,1fddia2k6sa4h800,1,No Administration,Picker,"It\xe2\x80\x99s run by kids. There is no real trading and it\xe2\x80\x99s not what they tell you. Very demanding. No Real HR. Expect to walk 10 miles a day. Also, if they first tell you what you will be doing, that\xe2\x80\x99s not true. You will get written up on everything. The pay isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth it. I thought I was making more. Never truthful. no CEO on-site "
Amazon,1fddhmptau29d800,2,Repetitive and tiring,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,It\xe2\x80\x99s a nice job if you are going to school because it gives you the flexibility but not for full time it can be restrictive in a way bcuz they require us to take an hour break. Super easy but repetitive .  
Amazon,1fddbi93rnq1d800,2,If you're a workbody and don't mind isolation,Picker,"Ok pay, good that it's full time. Very lonely and mentally draining as a picker once you learn the ropes. Very repetitive and isolating. Overtime pay is good but rarely used if you can't recover from normal shift hours."
Amazon,1fdda1u7fnpl7802,3,Alright but exhausting,Sortation Associate,"It\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad job to have really but it is super tiring to work there. Since they only have 10 or 12 hour shifts, by the end of your shift you feel like you wanna drop dead. The only good this is they offer 3-4 days off each week depending on what shift you get. Working there is okay too. There are so many different types of managers, no one really knows who to go to for their concerns. If you plan on working here, invest in memory foam running shoes! Your feet will thank you I promise you. The ones they offer you on Zappos are not comfortable!! It\xe2\x80\x99s decent money too, you won\xe2\x80\x99t make anything less than $15 an hour and obviously you\xe2\x80\x99ll get more for working weekends or overnights. I\xe2\x80\x99ve known a few people making $20 an hour for entry level positions. Benefits are good, your first year you get 4 and a half vacation days, 4 paid time off days, then it goes up each year. And 2 days of unpaid time off every 3 months no matter how long you\xe2\x80\x99ve been there. "
Amazon,1fdd7ppqks7l5802,4,BUSY very goal oriented , Yard Marshal,busy alot of company policy changes be ready to go with the flow hard long days. Be prepared for busy peak seasons and alot of mandatory overtime very flexible  tho
Amazon,1fdd4rmr1sa4h802,5,not fun,Packer,long days long hours can really do anything  good money but it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth standing up for long hours it takes a toll on your back and legs after awhile 
Amazon,1fdd46iktnpl7802,1,You are less than a number,Transportation Associate,"Constant favoritism and politics. That's the culture: bitter, lazy, no teamwork. Experienced and hard workers get stuck with extra work. Senior coworkers sit around; new guys do everything. Don't work here."
Amazon,1fdd31s3hsa4h802,3,Flexible Schedule,FC Associate I,The best part of this job is it\xe2\x80\x99s flexibility. The work was easy to learn. But the management was not that good. Had a lot of individuals with high ranking positions that knew nothing about managing or leading individuals. 
Amazon,1fdd24pcms7l5801,3,It’s what you make of it,Stow Associate,"I\xe2\x80\x99ve been with Amazon for almost 8 years. It\xe2\x80\x99s all about standing out and getting in with the higher ups. They hire college graduates as new managers, so of course they don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like working from the bottom. Their internal interview process needs to be more towards the actual position instead of asking the same questions from their question bank. The STAR method is easy to get a hang of, but it\xe2\x80\x99s still dependent on who does your interview. The work hours are long and the concrete floor has messed up my feet and lower back. The benefits can\xe2\x80\x99t be beat, but then you feel like you\xe2\x80\x99re trapped working there because no other job can compete with their insurance. "
Amazon,1fdd0bibau29d802,5,Good ,"Technician, amazon",Feel like a slave be prepared to be standing up all day and cannot go to the restroom for more than 5 min\xc3\xbates  they will over work you and make everything fast pace 
Amazon,1fdcr5tqgu29d800,2,"Quick money, not good work",Sort Center Team Member,"I left because I moved away from the location, but would have left even if not moving, because management was so bad. There was no communication from them and it was almost impossible to quit when it came time to. "
Amazon,1fdcqtf4vnpl7801,5,Very relaxed,Shopper,"The job was pretty easy, just look for items, and pack them up. Very independent sort of job, that made it super easy to do things like request sick time. Only issue was getting your hours, but if you plan it out it makes life much easier."
Amazon,1fdcotposu29d800,2,Not a great place to work,Warehouse Associate,Amazon is a huge company with a very high turnover rate for a reason. They don\xe2\x80\x99t pay enough for what you do. You work long hours and don\xe2\x80\x99t get to know your co-workers.
Amazon,1fdcn9foeu23m802,4,A lot of work,Warehouse Associate,"A mindless job, put yourself in autopilot and make a check. Make sure you have good shoes and move around. Drink water when you can and use the bathroom before shift and on breaks and lunches. "
Amazon,1fdchfh26u29d802,5,It is what you make of it ,Fulfillment Associate,It is what you make of it. Great benefits.  Chances for education.  They have different shifts you can pick.  I just wish they had onsite daycare. Bonuses
Amazon,1fdcd2u5du23m802,2,Boring but good pay,Warehouse Worker,"They started me off as a stower which is pretty boring in my opinion. Great pay, nice managers, and unmotivated people sums up the workplace. Goals set by the company are unrealistic and the 12 hour shifts really kill your body. Other than that, good job to get straight out of high school."
Amazon,1fdc7on6gu29d802,5,"Surprisingly, they actually try.",Sortation Associate,Everyone in the facility are the nicest people you'll meet. Management will not only engage you on the problems you need to address but also follow up to see if the problem was resolved.
Amazon,1fdc3evq7u29d800,1,Horrible place to work,Tier 3 Associate,If you want to be treated horribly and get taken advantage of this is the place for you. It is a do as I say not as I do kind of work place. You won\xe2\x80\x99t get ahead unless you throw everyone else under every bus possible. 
Amazon,1fdc2nvdqu29d800,3,It an okay job,Shipping recieving Associate,It could be a whole lot better. The pay is minimal. The managers arent the best. They are unorganized and treat you like slaves for the most part. And their way of speaking to you is disrespectful. The benifits are good tho.
Amazon,1fdc14r42u29d800,4,"Easy work , good paycheck.",Amazon Warehouse Associate,10 hour shifts weren\xe2\x80\x99t the easiest but the work is super easy & the pay wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too bad. Once you\xe2\x80\x99re there long enough you get trained to do other jobs so that was cool too.
Amazon,1fdc0bojhu29d800,5,Pay,Stower,"Amazon pays good staff was nice it\xe2\x80\x99s a good job but they over work employees, unorganized, clean environment also like that they feed their employees enjoyed weekly pay."
Amazon,1fdbscfeeu1ch800,3,Warehouse ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Working at the fulfillment center at Amazon was pretty straight forward. You do the same thing everyday. You make sure the packages go to the right spot 
Amazon,1fdbr0bs2u3rp801,2,Pretty decent job if you don't mind being under constant stress and getting yelled at by some people.,Customer Service Representative,"Ok, so the pay was alright first off. But, what you have to go through in order to get paid is the tough part. If you don't mind being yelled at by customers or being under time limits to finish a call you'll be fine for the job. Just know that you can't say anything to the customer in a bad way and also you need to finish your calls quickly or else you'll get pulled aside by your manager who is never present unless there is news or you did something wrong. The structure of the customer service sections is very disorganized. Don't be surprised if someone from another department transfers a call to you and you have no idea what to do. Also if you find yourself lost always say you're taking it up with a team lead because they feel like they are being treated well. "
Amazon,1fdbqua7tocbf800,1,Super overly strict they don't care no respect for employees,Packer/Picker,I watched people pass out daily get hospitalized from the overly high work demands they have... Worked there for almost 8months before I ever met my direct supervisor or manager. Lack of training is always the employees fault no matter much you push for more and if you don't meet demands they will write you up. If you need to use the bathroom better learn to hold it cause they track you if you walk away from you work station for drink of water bathroom or ask for help you better have a really good reason for it even when it's 110+ degrees in the building 
Amazon,1fdbqk1e6u3rp800,4,Good job,ICQA Associate,"If you want to make a lot of money real quick, Go to Amazon. Unless you\xe2\x80\x99re always late or a thief it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get fired. You can move up very fast. You just have to put in work that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Great coworkers who help make the shift go by"
Amazon,1fdbldsv9sa1g801,4,Remote Customer Service,Remote Customer Service Associate,"Great opportunity for working from home. Have to become familiar with all the policies available and how the scripts work to give you what you need to solve the customer's problem. Not a lot of opportunities for advancement, a lot of external hiring, internally most opportunities are lateral. You can learn a lot. Team leads are hit or miss - I found that team leads who have moved through the ranks at amazon are truly amazing while external hires cannot provide the same knowledge and support. Ultimately, I couldn't handle the stress or hours. The thing about providing customer service over the phone is that customers feel a sense of anonymity and some will treat you horribly without breaking any of the rules needed to be able to elevate the call. There's usually very little time to destress from calls. Paid training, pretty nice. They ease you into call types by having you handle simple call types at first before you graduate to the more general pool."
Amazon,1fdbkh9tbsa1m802,1,quick buck,sort,"if you can last, your back won't. there is no work life balance and the perks suck. the one positive that makes sense is that you get health insurance starting on day 1. "

Amazon,1fdbk1dmpocbf801,3,Lack of Management support,Food Production Worker,Managers are so caught up in other departments that they hardly ever look over to see how we (produce department) are doing. They prioritize other departments way more than our very own. As well as not making sure we always have things such as gloves or tools to use in our daily tasks. 
Amazon,1fdbgtu0iu3rp801,4,A job ,Amazon Delivery Driver,When it come to flexible at amazon where house you deff have 3 days off. Good benefits decent pay but management are not great they ignore you. They Act like they are god
Amazon,1fdbeiiolu37o801,3,Decent job but hard on the body.,Warehouse Associate (Seasonal),"Amazon overall is a good company to work for. The job itself was decent, it's manual labor so it's not the best job in the world but it's not so bad and keeps you active. "
Amazon,1fdb9uhbkocbf802,2,If you like being mind numbing bored...,Inventory Control Specialist,"Terrible, they just hire with no mind to any previous experience and stick you in a basic job with 10 minutes of instruction you are to expected to stay busy for 10 hours with zero direction. If you're not scanning you're in trouble. If you run out of work, look busy. Learn something new? Nope, no one available on your shift to show you. Don't leave the building unless it's break or you'll be asked why. Like working in prison I imagine"
Amazon,1fdb8mh51sa1g800,5,Wonderful,Warehouse Worker,Great company great pay . Easy work would reccomend the job to others . Every job has its strengths and flaws. Amazon is a better place then most to work at. 
Amazon,1fdb58gd1sa1g800,3,Repetitive ,Associate,"It beats working at fast food or some places that pay less than $15/hour. It's just work, if you're good at doing repetitive work, this job might be for you."
Amazon,1fdb43k1ksa1g802,4,Good place,Customer Returns Processor,"Amazon return facility is a good place to work, the job is not hard at all I would have liked more hours I didn't like the flex part of the job but was overall happy."
Amazon,1fdatukv3sa1g800,2,At Amazon employees are disposable. ,Sortation Associate,"People are nice enough. It's a warehouse so temperature extremes.  Work is overwhelming  because the culture is to get the work done with as few employees as possible.  We now have less employees doing MORE work than when I first started. I heard that the building manager gets a nice bonus by over working employees.   But we do have rainbow flags and all kinds of woke stuff all around, so I guess that makes up for treating employees like slaves. "
Amazon,1fdasrpf1sa1g801,2,The culture is that of a kindergarten class,Transportation Associate,"Amazon does not care to retain any of their good employees. The people with the best work ethic and the one that know the job the most get used excessively. If someone new comes in with terrible work ethic and doesn't even know the role, just as long as they interview well or have connections with the managers they will get promoted to manage the hard workers.

Amazon,1fdanfduusa1g801,1,Very stressful,Loader/Unloader,My time working at Amazon was atrocious for a great company the management was terrible and the hours are really bad . Most of us have families and they expect you to work forever in their warehouse with 30 min lunches when it\xe2\x80\x99s takes 15 minutes to go through security check and get to the cafeteria same with the 15 min breaks . Many people died driving home due to exhaustion after being in a hot trailer with little help . Due to another shifts neglect I had a wall full of boxes drop on me after I was told to try and fix their mistakes . I\xe2\x80\x99m only 5\xe2\x80\x992 Inshoudl at least have some help . Most of the men are lazy they will hide and watch you work . Pay is good but at what cost ? 
Amazon,1fdamj58pu3rp802,3,Needs better working conditions ,Area Manager,If you can handle stress then you can succedd. This is not for someone that wants to kick back. You are alert all hours of your shift. The workplace is toxic due to the high pressure.
Amazon,1fdak4ojmu37o801,2,"Consistent work labor, management prioritize favorites",Warehouse Associate,"Worked at Amazon for 3 years since 2018, know the whole production line from trailer to front door. Managers or \xe2\x80\x9cLeadership\xe2\x80\x9d show absolutely no appreciation for hard working staff, give no reasonable accommodations to long term employees even if it results in termination, promote based off of a templated interview, they do not consider your labor but more of how you say you work. They\xe2\x80\x99ll change your schedule whenever they feel necessary, they\xe2\x80\x99ll offer you transfers to different stations and threaten employment separation if you decline the offer. But, I can say that this company has showed me no matter how big and successful hard working employees can make a business, they\xe2\x80\x99ll still deliberately show you how little they care about you, they treat employees like property, they\xe2\x80\x99re too rich to care. I would not recommend this company to anyone. "

Amazon,1fda2vdn2sa1m802,1,Management & HR need work,Amazon Warehouse Associate,Amazon management has no idea what they are doing or how to do their jobs. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do their jobs so they male the employees call the ERC (employee resource center) for every issues even it they can solve it at their level. Some managers think that they can say whatever the want and do whatever they want with no repercussions.  Also the HR representative can come in whenever he or she feels like coming into work.

You\xe2\x80\x99re hired and fired by a computer so rates matter. And just when you\xe2\x80\x99ve trained/ worked enough to meet them they put harder to reach rates in front of you Or you get moved to a different department to train there.

Amazon,1fd9scdi7u37o800,1,Poor ,DSP/Driver,"This company over works you for a very little pay. They don't really care for your safety, although they say they do. Their more worried about the customers. The emergency help line that you call when something happens while delivering, will have you on hold for hrs, and will have you speaking to multiple people, and still get no help. Customers don't pay attention to when there packages are arriving because they have their dogs out. They won't answer the phone when you call to try to deliver. It's a lot dealing with this company, and they have no compassion for the employees. I've suffered from heat exhaustion on a 187 stop route, in 95 degree weather. "
Amazon,1fd9nkq50ocat800,2,See below.,Stower,"There's little to be said here that hasn't already been voiced by so many people. Amazon pays fairly, has a robust system in place that will help you along, and the work, while mundane and physically taxing (especially if you work an overnight shift- very deleterious to your health) is not really cruel or overwhelming. It's just that the overall experience has no soul. Granted, I worked there while everyone wore a mask, but I don't believe it makes a difference otherwise. People come and go in tired droves. You have a nice interaction with someone one day, trade a couple of smiles, an empathetic line or two, and you may never see them again. There are supervisors who stop by every few days for maybe 10 to 15 seconds. They ask you: How are you doing? You answer. They are holding a clipboard or a box cutter. They look world weary. You pity them. Do they pity you? They leave. You are hauling grass seed. You are shuffling iPhone cases. You are sorting lingerie. You are looking at a bicycle helmet. Where is the barcode? A box can fit one hundred more boxes. Pillows and pills and baby books and tape and dust and toxicity labels. You are hauling cat food. You are falling behind the clock. The clock turns red. You are moving with speed and intensity. You grip, turn clockwise and counterclockwise, you peer this way and another, you find a tear in the cover of one of thirty copies of a New York Times best-seller. You set it aside where the recycling is piling up. It's hot. Sweat fills your gloves. You are following the steps of the ROBOTS acronym which delineates the entirety of your"

Amazon,1fd9b9ktdocbf800,2,Pay is ok if you have no other option ,Warehouse Associate,They will fire you based on their own system glitches. They will also bait and switch you as to what building you will work at. Bathrooms are so far away that it kills an entire brake to use them. Injuries are ignored and a good way to be fired.

Amazon,1fd8rk34tt3ot800,2,No cohesiveness throughout the departments,ERC Disability and Leaves Services Agent,"They had a great idea to incorporate the department but there was not set guidelines or policies for the process implementation.  The suggestions given to management were rarely implemented.  When problems/issues were presented, the response was always, ""we\'re working on that"" with no evidence of resolutions.  Extremely difficult to advance in the company without knowing someone that will push for you to get another position.  Your education/experience is not enough for you to get another position or keep a position. Amazon is definitely about who you know."

Amazon,1fd8oskej308h001,3,Amazon Warehouse Employment,Inbound Area Manager,I was initially excited about the opportunity to work for Amazon until about week 5 where I started to not enjoy going to work.  The positives: I loved my team of associates and the work was challenging.  The negatives: My manager became less supportive of me as time went on.  There were 43 separate applications available to manage work and associates.  Associates often would not come back after breaks or lunch without any notification.   Warehouse environment wasn't for me.  Wish I had a better experience.

The only issue I had was it\xe2\x80\x99s very easy to get terminated. Don\xe2\x80\x99t take a shift unless you are 100 % sure you can do it because a couple points and you will be terminated. It\xe2\x80\x99s the perfect job for people in school or people who need extra money and want to choose when they go to work. "
Amazon,1fd8inevq3h80001,3,Not bad but needs more organization ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Not bad but the job needs more organization. Too much pressure to work fast so the pressure needs to be lifted some. There was a lot of moving around and supervisors were confusing each other.

Amazon,1fd8faoighihf801,2,Too unstable of a work environment,Warehouse Associate,"I was hired at this warehouse when it first opened. Everything was fresh, new, and shiny. I genuinely enjoyed working here for the first couple of months. Great coworkers, great management, we got so many free things like lunches and merchandise, and it was a lot of fun doing the work no matter how exhausting it was. We truly felt like a team. That all quickly went downhill.About 3-4 months into employment, the head of the warehouse was abruptly fired. It really killed employee morale because we got to see firsthand just how undervalued everyone is there if the warehouse head can get fired with no opportunity to improve themselves. It took a while before an interim warehouse head could be appointed and even longer before we had a permanent one in their place. Turnover suddenly became very high as people got burnt out, fired, or whatever else. The warehouse culture completely changed and many of the coworkers I loved were gone and replaced with people who were rude or did not care about doing their job. Management went from kind and helpful to a bunch of dictators who tried to force the rules onto everybody and didn\xe2\x80\x99t really listen to employee concerns.The warehouse got a major remodeling that stressed everyone out because it felt like there was less space when everything was said and done. I had to leave because it was just depressing being there and knowing how great it used to be. This is ignoring everything else that goes on with this company. To list some other cons, parking was absolutely terrible at this place. Also twice during my time there, they changed shifts"

Management sort of sucks especially when there\xe2\x80\x99s always a new one fresh out of college telling everyone how they should do the job they\xe2\x80\x99ve done for years. The place is a revolving door for management and associates alike, there\xe2\x80\x99s always someone new and everyone\xe2\x80\x99s expendable. There\xe2\x80\x99s a severe lack of appreciation with this company. If you come to work you\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to have a job which is the only real positive takeaway.

In the 8-9 months I have worked here they have hired 10-15 new people a day. Which makes us get sent home early a lot due to no work. The management was not good. A lot of the changes that would happen the employees wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t learn about until the day they took affect. I highly recommend not going above and beyond because if you are getting a higher rate but mess up you\xe2\x80\x99ll still get introuble as if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t just go over your limit. Over all highly don\xe2\x80\x99t recommend working for Amazon. If you can I would find a different job.

Came back as a Level 4 OMR In safety. Pay is great. However it doesnt come without the negative. You\xe2\x80\x99re basically a first aid employee. You rarely use your actual EMT skills at all. Just know you are not an EMT like in the field. You push a lot of paper work. If you can wrap your head around that, it\xe2\x80\x99s a great position that will take care of your family and finances. Lots of overtime. "
Amazon,1fd731idrocao802,3,Meh. ,Warehouse Associate,Job is hard depending on what area your working in. Strange 10 hour schedule but you get used to it. Working in trucks is extremely hit and not well vinilated.

I think the work was fairly easy and straightforward and the pay was pretty good. Location was far away for me. I found that managers and supervisors were constantly changing and most managers didn't really take the time to be personable. They claim to care about individuals and their physical + mental health but that was not reflected in reality. Raises were nonexistent....."

Amazon,1fd4328ufhimt800,5,Multiple career paths with advancement opportunities. ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"Although Amazon provides good benefits and an easy to use PTO system, the overall pay compensation for employees is minimum wage and bonuses are heavily taxed. They do not seem to appreciate their veteran employees and have a very young management culture. Ultimately, it feels like we are training A.I. to replace us. The overall work environment has lost its sense of employee ownership and family oneness to become very segmented and corporately deterministic. Inconsistent hiring wages is unfair when new hires in the same building doing the same job get paid at various hiring wages. This is once again benefiting an untrained new hire to a veteran employee who will teach them how to do the job?!"

The job hours with full time can be draining especially when your graveyard. But the pay makes up for it most definitely. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a job you can really advance in but it will get you the money you need until you get a replacement. People here are nice. Job culture is great. 
Amazon,1fd3q34m8hihf802,3,The pay is great,Inbound floor woker,They work you like a dog but the pay is great. And so is the benefits you have to pass a mouth swab drug test but you get benefits and everything start the first day.

Amazon,1fd3amo7dhihf800,2,Never run out of work,Packer,Work life balance isn\xe2\x80\x99t the best. It\xe2\x80\x99s very tiring. Especially graveyard shift. You get paid .65 cents more if you work graveyard. At least at my location. 
Amazon,1fd39aqpthihf802,5,Good pay and They Care,Customer Service Representative,"They really care bout you . Lots of PTO and leaves available. The hours can get a bit crazy, but you get paid for all of your overtime. There is a long training period in which you cannot miss any days . Overal great company "
Amazon,1fd35rjk9ocao801,5,Good job,Flex Delivery Driver,Its a good job nothing special pays ok. Friendly people are nice and overall good. Grabbing shifts can be hard but they are there just need to pay attention 
Amazon,1fd32n08o308h002,5,Great people to work with.,FC Associate I,Great opportunity for advancement. Your job is explained well and management is very helpful. The people you work with are pleasant to work with. Cool place to work at. 
Amazon,1fd2vikc8ocao800,1,Amazon's management are very rude people ,Paker,"The worse place to work for amazan, you will zero respect,you have to stand \xf0\x9f\xa7\x8d\xe2\x80\x8d\xe2\x99\x82\xef\xb8\x8f 10 hours on your feet, if they see you setting they will come to you and tell you to stop it."
Amazon,1fd2rdqbgocao802,4,Rewarding but demanding ,Digital Associate customer service ,"Although I've only been with the company a little over 3 months, I find that the position is very demanding and can be stressful at times. I feel the metrics are a bit strict and find it hard to reach those metrics with the time allocated.  Its not a job for everyone,  you work from home but you literally are tied to your desk. I beleive you can succeed once you find your groove. Leadership is very helpful and they really do want you to succeed. "
Amazon,1fd2q6jt3s9u9802,3,Decent ,FC Associate I,It\xe2\x80\x99s an ok place to work at if your only in it for the money. Breaks were very short so don\xe2\x80\x99t expect long breaks. Was very hard to get days off. Sometimes we were understaffed which meant you had to stay extra hours.
Amazon,1fd2n0atk3h80001,2,"Okay to shop from, not so much to work for",Warehouse Associate,"I had let the management know prior to being hired of a disability I have with my disks in my spine. They still hired me, then during training had no where to place me because I was unable to perform most tasks per my chiropractor\'s care instructions. I was told I was let go for ""job abandonment"" when in reality the company didn\'t listen to me before hiring me and told me they ""had no other position that I would be able to do"". The team supervisors were amazing with trying to find little tasks I could perform to make sure I wasn\'t losing out on a ton of hours, but in the end their hands were tied and there wasn\'t much they could do. One other thing I found very inconvenient as an employee is that there are HR personnel in the warehouse, but any HR questions employees had to call a 1-800 number for. It made absolutely no sense to me. "
Amazon,1fd2mrcbvocao801,2,"Productive, high pace, flexible, has everything you need",Warehouse Associate,"Not a fun workplace. Majority of the time your going to be on your feet sweating profusely because theres no air in the warehouse. The break is 20 min not bad but if you get to the dock late from your break you get warnings by the managers their. They had 2 managers and like 100 employees this one time it was very unprofessional. Managers talk alot so if you feel like you need a break just ask a random question to a manager. If your new don't worry they have ambassadors (BLUE VEST) aka learning instructors to help you with anything. If someone did something you didn't like, I suggest you go to a ambassador they seem to be more understanding and will do something."
Amazon,1fd276ftqs9u9800,3,Side Gig,Self-Employed Amazon Flex Driver,This is good if you are looking for extra money. This is a lot of wear and tare on your own vehicle. They no longer have daytime shifts they all start at around 5pm and you could be driving anywhere.
Amazon,1fd1q485nhihf801,5,Amazing job with an amazing company!,Customer Service Representative,"Working remotely for Amazon.com was an all around wonderful,  fulfilling experience.  Pay was great,  shift was perfect. If not for Covid-19,  I would have never left."
Amazon,1fd1gq6ft308h000,2,Not Transparent,Sr. HR Assistant,The expectation to be available at any time to a population of hundreds of warehouse employees while still completing menial mind numbing daily tasks are impossible to balance.
Amazon,1fd116p9as9u9802,3,Speed and consistency ,Packer,So to work at the fulfillment center in packaging you have to get a rate. So if you been there a month your rate has to match someone of the same time frame. Guess what 180 pieces an hour isn\xe2\x80\x99t good enough if the next guy can pack 300. Write ups happen and you have a week to improve or you get a second one another week to improve and a third one happens then you get fired. 
Amazon,1fd1060383h80000,2,Should be paid more for the amount of strenuous work they expect from you,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"They work you entirely too hard on the line for the pay they offer. The Packers are too worried about speed and not quality and are a cause to a lot of jams that occur on the line. Voluntary time off has its pros and cons. One good thing about it is that you can leave without attendance being an issue. The bad part is that you only get paid for the time you worked, they offer it as soon as the shift begins or 2-4 hours after the shift started, and they send way too many people home when they know there is never a moment where we're not busy. Management is horrible. Rarely any team work. Lunch should be at least an hour. Benefits are fine"
Amazon,1fd0sq31ahimt800,3,Pay and benefits are alright,FC Associate,"Breaks are to short for the size of the building to get to and back from lunch. Your constantly moved around to different areas of the warehouse. Management doesn""t really pay attention to everything going on or know how to do certain things unless you  tell or show them."
Amazon,1fd0fpr0es9u9802,1,Maybe it was just my site…,Area Manager,"My fulfillment center started off great and quickly went to trash. High turnover rate, lacked consistency, and the better employees are often over worked. "
Amazon,1fd0eu0ab308h002,1,It’s definitely an experience ,Warehouse Associate,"It\xe2\x80\x99s great for a short term job, you get paid good and get a paycheck every week. The job is very draining though, lots of physical labor. Kind of a depressing environment, but some may like it more than others. It just depends what you like and what your comfortable with. The managers are ehh, it definitely doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like a place you can easily work yourself up in, they make it obvious you are replaceable and they really don\xe2\x80\x99t need you. I had a 40 year old learning ambassador continuously hit on me knowing that I\xe2\x80\x99m 18. Creepy, very creepy. They hire anyone and everyone so you there could be a bunch of weird people working because Amazon really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care if they hire pediphiles and drug addicted I guess."
Amazon,1fd0dp5tgs9u9802,1,Don’t do it! ,Driver,Amazon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about you. The pay is horrible. The routes are done from a computer and the Amazon employee that is supposed to do their job by fixing computer mistakes doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care. Been delivering over 2 years and NO ONE FIXES NOTHING! Amazon lies! NOT A GOOD PLACE TO WORK AT ALL!
Amazon,1fd0aaeti308h002,3,fast-pace and high energy,Warehouse Worker,"if you're looking for a stress-free environment, amazon is not the place for you. working for the database portion of amazon (so they can assess your performance and see where you\xe2\x80\x99ll fit when working for the actual franchise) was extremely taxing. not knowing your placement, what section you\xe2\x80\x99ll be working in along with the feeling of being watched (because you are) were all factors in mentally and physically draining. if you\xe2\x80\x99re into fast-paced, ever-changing roles in the warehouse this is the perfect place for you. the co-workers are friendly and the \xe2\x80\x9cfun\xe2\x80\x9d environment keeps you energized. the breaks are quick to leave as they are to come and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be on your feet most of the day. "
Amazon,1fd08ci82308h002,1,Not worth it,Transportation Associate,"Pays well. Lazy coworkers. No teamwork. Too much gossip, favorites and clicks. No professional behavior. Open dating of employees. Too much whining. Toxic work environment. Weak boss, no authority, doesn't care. Prefers friends over hard workers. People show up hours late everyday. "
Amazon,1fd04mgedhimt802,2,Run!,Picker/Packer,Your feet will hurt. You will feel pressure to not have time off task. So much that you won\xe2\x80\x99t even want to use the restroom until break. Very stressful place! You are overworked and just a number. 
Amazon,1fd04fk0b308h000,3,"Fun job, excruciating back pain.",Tier 1 Associate,"Working in the Amazon warehouse was a lot more fun than I had expected, but also a lot more painful than I expected. Even with decent shoes my body can\xe2\x80\x99t handle standing 10 hours a day on the concrete floors, doing 20,000+ steps a day. There is little downtime and you are constantly busy, so no real time for your body to catch a break. The 30 minute breaks aren\xe2\x80\x99t long enough for your body to recover either. Working at peak for 10 hours a day isn\xe2\x80\x99t healthy nor is it sustainable. Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s customer obsession comes at the expense of their employees physical health, unfortunately. It\xe2\x80\x99s now quite obvious to me why their staff turnover is 150%. I went in expecting a toxic work environment with horrible managers, and found great people and managers with a job that destroys your body. I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked in jobs where I have been on my feet 12+ hours a day, they pale in comparison to the Amazon warehouse. $15.50 an hour isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth causing long term damage to your physical health. I rated it 3 stars because if you can handle the physical aspect, I think it would be a great place for you to work. For me, no amount of money is worth the excruciating back pain. "
Amazon,1fd03n0s6hihf802,5,Amazon is a great place to work,Warehouse Associate,Amazon is a really good place to work. The sort center was fast paced and I like it. The mangers were cool too. The schedule wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that bad. Some days you could flex up or down
Amazon,1fd03ivmes9u9800,3,A job to stay a year or two ,FC ASSOCIATE I,The benefits are amazing. Sadly when you work hard but managers have preferences you will not go anywhere. It is a job that makes your body suffer the consequences. 
Amazon,1fd020gkmhimt802,3,Good pay hours could be better,Warehouse Worker,10 hours a day for 4 days with 3 days off was okay. However 4 10 hours shifts took a toll on my body. I would prefer if it were 4 8 hour shifts instead for a slightly reduced pay.
Amazon,1fd00rsm1s9u9800,4,Fast pace yet fun ,FC Associate I,The job is fast pace however there are tons of people to help make the day go by faster. I started almost 7 months ago and in that time I have been taught 5 different roles and have had the opportunity to become a learning ambassador after being there for just 4 and a half months. They hold you accountable for what you do and really try and make sure every person is successful every day. 
Amazon,1fcvt5tj8himt802,1,One of the worst workplace experiences I've ever had and I've been working for 40 years ,Associate,Shiesty workplace practices and massive disorganization. I would HIGHLY recommend having a second job if working at Amazon as your job is definitely not secure.
Amazon,1fcvt3pq9ocao800,1,They treat you like a third world employee. ,Picker,"Don't be fooled they place you in the highest turnover department and be prepared for a physiological breakdown. It's highly intimidating, you feel in fear of your job and they write you up to keep you from transferring to another position. "
Amazon,1fcvp5p053h80001,3,Good pay but it really leaves no time for anything else ,Warehouse Associate,Every day I leave work in a lot of pain and no motivation to do anything else with my day. The days are very stressful and understaffed with no one being fully trained to do what they need to do because of the high turnover rate.
Amazon,1fcvmgr6qs9u9801,4,A good place to work,Analyst,"Enjoyed working at Amazon.  Everyone is fun to work with.  The few disgruntled folks left on their own, not because they were fired for poor work performance.  Overall, I recommend the company"
Amazon,1fcvm1p4ghihf802,4,Place is strees free,Printer Operator,Been here for 3 years it a easy and good paying job with a flexible schedule. You can always take time off when you need to with your own hours or you can just take a leave of absence
Amazon,1fcvkpf11s9u9802,3,"Job was okay, but wasn’t for me",Warehouse Associate,"Lots of physical labor while working as a warehouse associate. Most of the positions there require you to do physical labor. Some days you get easy days where there\xe2\x80\x99s a low volume of packages for that day and some days you get very busy days, especially during peak week which is usually around Christmas time. You meet a lot of cool people there, and you can listen to music while you work(well, when I was there. Not sure if that\xe2\x80\x99s changed or not) "
Amazon,1fcv7641d3h80002,4,Good ,Warehouse Associate,"Good company to work for work life balance is good. They are very flexible with scheduling, they need more people the pay is good and the work isn\xe2\x80\x99t hard "
Amazon,1fcv1ummm308h002,3,Decent job,Associate,Very repetitive work but the people are cool long hours but if you\xe2\x80\x99re luck to land in a good spot it isn\xe2\x80\x99t that bad management can be better definitely a stepping stone in your career not a long term plan
Amazon,1fcuvf3stocao802,2,Boring and slow,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,It is a repetitive job where you feel no satisfaction because there will always be more stuff to scan and you never will accomplish anything. The only way they commend you on your hard work is by giving you a pin but they give you the same pin when you start so it was useless.
Amazon,1fcun7ashs9u9802,3,Productive ,Amazon Warehouse Associate,"Hr at that place is a joke, have to constantly worry bout getting fired , no air conditioner or at least we don\xe2\x80\x99t feel it you sweat more than a stuffed pig in that place "
Amazon,1fculsposhimt800,5,"Productive and fun workplace. Customers are stressful, but office was great. ",Seasonal Customer Service Representative,I loved working there. The hours were great. The office is great. The customers are demanding and needy though. But it's a very welcoming environment.

Amazon,1fcubbar5hihf800,4,"Flexible schedule, pay is ok for position",Customer Service Representative,"High call volume, every day is a new day @ Amazon. Things are always changing. But they do have a flexible schedule once you are permanent. You also might move around in departments as well."
Amazon,1fcuaoucphihf801,2,They will work you to death,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,It's a stressful job. There's no clear path for advancement. Pay is low. Management doesn't really care about you. They don't even care to learn your name. Decent benefits. Good for a part-timer or student 
Amazon,1fcuaibfihihf802,2,Too many kids working here,FC Associate I,Very stressful work environment.  Kids on phone constantly missing deadlines but management doesn't seem to notice or care.  Take too long in the bathroom or returning from lunch and the world ends.
Amazon,1fcu9fnk7ocao802,3,Good for a little break,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,I needed a break from property management and Amazon was good for that.  The schedule worked for what I needed but I never felt accomplished doing any of the work.  I was just a cog in the system.
Amazon,1fcu7bq6mocao800,2,Lots of time off options,Warehouse Associate,"Other than the time of options that are available to you and the benefits, there really is nothing good about working at amazon. Managers get changed every 2-3 months and each set of managers have their own group of ""Favorite"" associates. Apart from 2 of the managers I worked with, who knew what they were doing, every other manager either screwed up the outbound process or was completely clueless. The PA\'s were usually more helpful than the managers were. Getting hold of the HR department was easy when it concerned easy and simple HR related questions but wen it came to the more complicated inquires, HR personal would just close the HR cases without replying or solving anything and trying to get in contact with them was pretty useless. "
Amazon,1fcu2rcess9u9802,2,It’s not for everybody ,Picker,Your feet will hurt. You will feel pressure to not have time off task. So much so that you won\xe2\x80\x99t even want to use the restroom until break. The pay is fair & weekly. 
Amazon,1fcu2d7vt3h80002,3,Chill,Warehouse Associate,It was a decent job it just wasn't a job for me. I didn't see myself being there long term and I had a better opportunity so I decided to leave. But if you need money and don't mind long hours on your feet its cool.
Amazon,1fcts7fumhimt801,5,Great Job!,Home Seasonal Customer Service Representative,"This is the best C/S job I ever had in over 20 years of doing it. Amazon allows you to actually resolve customer issues to their satisfaction, and yours. Wonder environment with many levels of support for any questions or issues you may have! Highly recommend this company and job!"
Amazon,1fctrogvghimt800,4,Great place to work with flexible hours,Warehouse Worker,I enjoyed working at Amazon. My only complaint is the way the shift intervals are designed because I worked doubles.  Sometimes you will wait 1-2 hours before the next shift starts depending on each shift lasts. 
Amazon,1fctnkn9fhimt802,4,Decent company but you have to want to work,Picker/Packer,"So far amazon has been a decent company to work for. I'm new so this isn't going to be too long, but the pay is fair compensation for my work. Unpaid time off, PTO, and vacation time in addition to day one benefits at competitive prices is fantastic. Only thing is if you want to to work at amazon, you need to be ready to work. But that's the deal, its work. If you  want overtime, go get some, there is tons of availability. "
Amazon,1fctmf6n2himt801,4,Overnight at amazon,Sortation Associate,"Job is not as bad as people say, you\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to use the bathroom when you want, people are just lazy and think they should get paid like they have a degree for simple warehouse work, you just have to be on your feet for 10 hour shifts, and if you\xe2\x80\x99re not an extroverted person by nature you probably will not speak to many people for the night, if i worked first shift i would be highly satisfied with this job."
Amazon,1fctm5p2oocao802,3,"Pays the bills, usually a four day work week. Good benefits/time off.",Non-Inventory Receiver,"Decent job. They seemed to like fresh out of college hires for management, so your manager was often inexperienced. 4 day work weeks were nice. PTO and vacation standards were great."
Amazon,1fcte86f9308h001,2,Benefits great,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,If you need a job then this is the place. Easy to get in but hard to Stay. Some people think they are above you and will make you feel small which is not good management.
Amazon,1fctbprccs9u9802,3,It's not for everyone,Sort Associate/Shift Leader,"It can be tough in the beginning of you don't have warehouse experience. The training that you're given is a 1 shift crash course and then you're on your own. I'd recommend learning critical roles so you're not stuck doing the same thing over and over. It can be very mindless work which can get boring over time. They offer voluntary time off which can be addicting if you don't really need the job. If you need a job, don't care what you do, and want to work the extra time then go ahead. If you want flexibility with your shift, it may not be for you. Once you're locked into your shift it can be hard to get out of it. "
Amazon,1fctb722shihf801,2,Work hours and work dangers ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,I have tried to change my schedule multiple times due to being a college student. The hours I work are not compatible with school. I won't get out of work till 12:30 a.m. or even 1:30 a.m. Then I'm expected to attend school the next day at 8:30 a.m. I've talked to Human Resources but still nothing. They tend to flex up a lot: meaning they add time to your shift. They can add up to an hour. And they will tell you 2 hours before your shift ends. That's what makes a lot of people want to leave. The pay is not too bad but you would need to work a lot of days to get a good pay. I only work 4 shifts and make $300 maximum. There are 401k plan and health insurance. 
Amazon,1fct0i596himt800,3,it was okay ,Amazon Sortation Associate,the hours were cool because you're always able to pick up extra shifts if needed. the work environment was not that great especially during the pandemic. 
Amazon,1fcssemb5himt800,3,Benefits ,Fullfillment Associate,Managers have there favorites. No advancements. Work is all about numbers. Rules DON'T apply to everyone. Some employees get away with not working at all while others work there butt off and there not recognized for it. Managers see it and don't DO anything. Hr no help they'll tell you to go back to manager on the floor. Big turnaround. Fire good hard workers and keep the lazy one. New employees get paid more than older employees. Salaries are different. No seniority rules. No structure.
Amazon,1fcsluirpocao802,4,Perfect place for first job experience!,Amazon PIT Operator,"Amazon makes a great first job if you're interested in working hard, gaining employment history, and making above-average money. It may be a bit grueling on the body long term. Once you join the team, you learn more about different departments and have the opportunity to advance. I'm a big fan of the A to Z employee app that allows you to track your time, your pay, vacation time, and much more. "

They usually included us in some of the great giveaways, etc that regular warehouse associates had. It\xe2\x80\x99s a 2 part job. Half consisted of calling customers to get updated/missing info such as apartment #\xe2\x80\x99s, gate codes, etc so that we could get the packages to them and the other half consists of taking, processing and shipping off returns. Not a bad job at all. At our site most people worked 4 ten hour shifts. I know that\xe2\x80\x99s not for everyone but I believe it varies per location."
Amazon,1fcs1acaf308h002,3,On your feet all day,Stower/Picker,"It was a fun environment.  My location was a smaller warehouse so almost everyone got along just well. But felt like we were robots. The constant beeping of the scanner, I can still hear it."

Amazon,1fcrehi83himt800,3,Okay job ,Warehouse Worker,"How to describe Amazon. I worked as a package sorter, and it was sometimes hectic. They don\xe2\x80\x99t really care about you as a person they just want you to be a robot and get the work done extremely fast.

Amazon,1fcr0mbbkhihf801,3,Great,Picker,"I worked in picking and it was great even though it was for just a short period of time. Management was straight-forward about what they expected from us, but they weren't constantly breathing down our throats while we worked. It was nice to be in a job where management was more (for the lack of a better word) hands-off compared to previous jobs I've had. "
Amazon,1fcqus4u3308h002,5,I’ve always loved working for Amazon ,Picker/Packer,"Working for Amazon is the most rewarding, confident feeling. For me I feel a sense of importance working for a company as big and successful as they are. The pay is good. There are always hours you can pick up. Their time off is fair, benefits and eventually a piece of stock are offered. The training I went through was exactly what I needed before starting off on my own. I\xe2\x80\x99m familiar with what my job consists of and what my responsibilities are. I worked at dfw 7 when I was 18 or 19. Recently came back at 24. Just as happy with it as I was before. "
Amazon,1fcqqrb40himt800,3,Its a great temp job but...,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"I would not consider amazon jobs a career. Its not hard work per say but I feel it, its a drain on your soul. No other way to put it. Easy enough to get hired there. No selection where you are going to be pout. I wish theyd at least try to give you an option, especially for a seasoned warehouse worker. I dont want to be packing 2 pound packages all day. Put me in the warehouse where Im going to sweat for a reason. They should see this at hirirng not just lump us all in one job they need for the week. Training is mostly done on the computer and you do have helpers that walk around you can ask but most of the time they seem to annoyed for your questions. You dont want to stop because look there go your numbers and youll have a person asking you basically why you suck and cant go any faster. I cant say that for all, lot of great people work there however the management is very strict and done by the book. You will get wrote up if you do something wrong which i Had no issues with. If you are slow they will tell you. You stretch every morning, which is fine. Im not a fan of the chants and stuff we do as a group. Just let me do my work of standing there for 10 hours and go home. Just for a reason I have NO IDEA why it just feels like a soul sucking job and place. Like the headline, GREAT temp job but its a soul taker."
Amazon,1fcqpt9fj308h001,3,Great job for temporary use,Warehouse Associate,"Great benefits and time off but underpaid for the workload. Most management are nice.

Amazon,1fcqkpnbjhimt800,4,Fast paced and good people to work with,Associate sort center ,"Better get ready to work! They will send out email/text messages offering voluntary time off which is non paid. The associates that do want to work or have to work for financial reasons are worked so hard that most cannot keep up and gets to overwhelming. The more you learn and more responsibility you take on the easier the job becomes. I am used to hard work (offshore oil rigs) so work load and hot warehouse atmosphere is no problem for me. I get treated like family there with most management staff and don\xe2\x80\x99t mind going to work. Everyday is different and nothing surprises me anymore, so if you can adapt on the fly and don\xe2\x80\x99t mind doing the work that normally takes 2 to 3 people, this job is for you"
Amazon,1fcqfcn1bs9u9800,5,Great company to work for,WHS Specialist,"Amazon is a great company to work with for both experienced and inexperienced job seekers.

All they want is to beat the numbers from last quarter and don\xe2\x80\x99t care about anything else. You will feel like a robot. 
Amazon,1fcqbo9dahihf802,2,Overworked and underpaid,Lead Problem Solver,"Managers will lie to you. Was told I would be Part-Time because I was in school, but was scheduled as a Full-Time employee anyway. HR really doesn't do anything to help.

Amazon,1fcq9vjuds9u9802,4,Not bad,Fulfillment Associate,"Pay is good and the work, depending on where your at and what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been trained to do, is simple not too demanding.

Amazon,1fcp4ap2uhihf802,2,Just a job,Picker,"If you are just looking for a job to pay bills this is it. During the global pandemic I learned this company barely cares about their employees. We are numbers that can be replaced. The work is pretty simple but complicated at the same time. Being that it is physically draining, which can mess with your mental. You are required to perform like a mouse on a wheel for pay that could be better. It is hot as the devils tongue in the building with fans at every OTHER station. You are considered lucky if you get a station with a fan. Lunches could be longer because by the time you get out of the building you got a good 15 minutes to eat and be back at your station. Management absolutely sucks, and the HR team is a joke. "
Amazon,1fcp1ora2308h002,5,Yes,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"I would do it, it's very easy and not stressful as people would think. I actually like the job but sometimes it gets boring and same thing over and over."

Amazon,1fcmpbbbbu4nb802,2,Its all about product and not about the associates,Warehouse Associate,"I do currently work here. I have been employed since 2019 had an UNPAID maternity leave because I wasn't a certain level to earn the pay I deserve. Managers definitely are on their high horses, and can never get down to our level to listen to our concerns or help us with some issues because they are more worried about how many packages are processed instead of how the associates really feel. It's very frustrating that it's like that. It was fun in the beginning, definitely. Who wouldn't love $15 an hour? It definitely gets old especially when the higher ups get under your skin.  Breaks are only 15 minutes, and it's really hard to stay motivated when you're not being treated fairly."
Amazon,1fcmovqtfu4nb802,1,No job security/job advancement,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"You will be fired over anything and everything. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost impossible to move up with the company unless you have a bachelors degree. Break times include your walk time, so if you have a 30 minute break but you\xe2\x80\x99re 10 minutes from a break room, you only get a 10 minute break because 20 minutes of it is walk time. "

If you're in a robotics warehouse, you'll have many different roles from unloading trucks, driving PIT, stowing product into the robots, picking products from the robots, packing product into boxes, and loading the boxes into the trucks. These are the direct roles, which you will most likely start in. They're repetitive and boring, so it's up to you to stay focused and make whatever arbitrary rate the building assigns you."

I honestly do not think that I will ever try applying here again. I ended up being a stower and didn't know that was my position until first day on the job (I always knew my job position before the first day by previous employers). Stowing literally was far too tedious, mentally and physically draining for me (I have worked in another place where I had to be on my feet constantly, was a fast pace environment, were I was lifting items 0-100+ pounds for around 10 or more hours 5 days a week. That place surprisingly wasn't so mentally and physically draining on me and the work was actually harder due to the true nature of the job and things that could be controlled such as weather conditions or when exactly stuff would be coming in due to traffic and whatnot). Anyways I seriously wouldn't recommend this job to a person I know due to things such as management not being present enough, not being told your actual work position until literally your first day, certain policies, and HR."

American-Express,1fjmsvgb9t4b9800,3,"It started out great, but that started to change in 2017...",Customer Care Professional,"The bad news:Starting in 2017, too much emphasis was placed on sales quotas.  In short, this started out as a true customer service position, and ended up a true sales job.  Also, they offshored or placed some jobs back into the brick-and-mortar U.S. centers, for quite a bit of the U.S.-based virtual team (check out the careers page:  you\'ll see very few jobs for U.S. employees are virtual now, most are in the brick-and-mortar centers, and even some of the virtual jobs are limited to states with centers).  The ironic aspect of this change:  this started to happen about a year or so before the pandemic.  Moving up is tricky in the virtual side, as well.  If you want to be a team lead, or a training coach, for example, you\'ll likely be in that position as ""interim"".  So, at any time, management can require an interim leader to go back on the phones, regardless of how long they\'ve been away from the direct customer care position.  Some people were interim for months, some for years.  In addition, that individual will receive absolutely no refresher training, and very little notice.  This exact scenario happened to one of my leaders in 2018 (""leader"" is plural, because I was moved to several different teams, due to schedule bids, and sometimes restructuring, but the good news was:  I worked well with every one of my leaders).  Schedule bids would happen about every few years, and they had already announced that they would switch from the bids being awarded based on a mix of tenure and metrics, to just metrics (again, see above, sales became THE most important metric).

You don\'t see it coming so when your leader informs you of your ratings, you\'re flabbergasted.  The rug is pulled out from under you and the writing is on the wall. Other leaders tell you that you didn\'t deserve the bad ratings you received.  It all boils down to that ""bell curve\'\'.  Not everyone can receive a great review even though everyone deserved it. I was completely loyal but in the end, I was someone who was making a great salary. They could get rid of me and being someone else in for half of what I was making.

Be prepared to be gaslit.  Know that work/life balance doesn't exist unless you're a man - then you're a good father for taking time for your family."

American-Express,1fgl3d2utn5d5800,3,Fun in the beginning ,Customer Care Professional,"When I first started I was working part-time which I love. Currently it is very rare that they have part time customer care associates. In the beginning it was nice because my main focus was helping the customer but towards the end, sales became the main focus. I was constantly being push to offer something to sale on every call when most people didn\xe2\x80\x99t need or couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford what was being offered. I was told it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what they called for I should be offering something. "

American-Express,1fgca3fg43kji001,1,Run ,Customer Care Professional,"Worst company ever. Amex does a great job recruiting people however once you\xe2\x80\x99re there? It\xe2\x80\x99s a different story. Micromanaging, metrics are horrible and they push you for sales however set the metrics so stringently that you\xe2\x80\x99re lucky if you receive a payout. They have a 3rd party team to monitor your calls and pull them at random and if you miss so much as a word of a disclosure you could be terminated. If a customer calls back within a seven day period it goes against your metrics as the highest weighing metric. No room for opportunity or advancement. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been with the company for years unfortunately. This job is mentally draining. You constantly feel scrutinized and like you\xe2\x80\x99re always under a microscope. Management does not promote a positive environment. You\xe2\x80\x99re never recognized for any positive attributes. This is a very toxic work environment. I\xe2\x80\x99ve witnessed discrimination of employees with chronic health conditions."
American-Express,1fgc5q0elu428802,4,"Great culture, but low pay and not easy to engage remotely",Product Management,"Amex is an employee-friendly company that is having a difficult time adapting to remote work.  I started after the company had already been remote for several months so I caught the tail end of management's efforts to make people feel comfortable and included while working remotely.  Amex is struggling to find it's footing in this new way of working because, until recently, it saw it as a temporary solution.  They are just now realizing that, in order to retain employees, they will need to be much more flexible.  They will also need to make sure they put programs in place to keep remote employees engaged so they feel like part of the company."
American-Express,1fg79qtvjs7mv800,3,Impossible to move up,Senior Travel Counselor,"I left amex after 3 years as a travel counsellor, management doesn't care about employee growth. I have previous training experience but was never allowed to branch into that area at amex. That on top of mandatory OT and not being able to get days off approved, it wasn't worth it. I wasn't even able to get two days of PTO to go see a sick family member."

Atlassian,1fbp4sf933kkq002,5,Work is work,Manager,It\xe2\x80\x99s a paycheck. Everyone cares about what they do which gives us a sense of camaraderie but they don\xe2\x80\x99t pay as well as the competition and raises are few and far between. Good culture though. 
Atlassian,1f3bvrhpsu3dj800,4,Good company for full time employees,Contractor,"I was a contract employee, so I can't say much about the benefits here. Although from heresy it's pretty great. It has gotten more bureaucratic as time has gone on, but the cofounders try to listen to their employees. My favorite part of the company is how they try to stick to their values."
Atlassian,1f1vtr27iu3hv800,4,Great company to work at if you are full time,Contractor,"If you are a full time employee, you will enjoy working here. Full time employees get great benefits and the company works hard to foster a sense of community. The founders seem to care about their employees. But in my experience, contractors are seen differently and my impression when I left is that they're going to divide that line further."
Atlassian,1djs6lse5b892802,4,Best recruiters I've worked with,Sr Recruiter,The recruiting team was full of rockstars. I learned a lot from every one of them. Team first atmosphere but the customer was the focus. Very good interview process.

Atlassian,1aqhsribhakaj8sb,2,"Good benefits, terrible management",Engineer,"Management does not respect engineering decisions and pushes their own political agenda. There is no accountability or ownership of anything, and when management says that there will be accountability what they mean is that engineers should be accountable for broken solutions forced on them by management. Management makes drastic and terrible decisions, and then claims everything is fine even though a large portion of engineers are angry about it and multiple have quit or transfered to other teams over it."

Bank-of-America,1dmr1papu52vr802,3,Typical corporate setting,Financial Advisor Development Program,Sales goals are unrealistic for First-time Advisors. The development program is a mess. You will end up figuring everything out for yourself. Be prepared to cold call and attend pointless meetings. People are very friendly until you end up competing with them to get on teams. Be ready to sell your soul.
Bank-of-America,1flibrlgqn59v800,4,Great workplace environment but work schedule could be better,Relationship Banker,"Been an employee for a few yesrs and have had a great experience as a teller and banker. My colleagues at my location makes it feel like family bond. As a banker, you are required to meet a variety of goals, some a bit unrealistic at times but still doable. I could see how someone could find it overwhelming. Pay is great, $21 an hour minimum wage and soon to be $25 an minimum. My only complaint is having to work just about every Saturday until 1pm and soon to be 2pm. I would get a Saturday off maybe every 2 or 3 months. Advancement opportunities are there but somewhat difficult to come by due to openings never being there as not many people leave the company to vacant an opening."

So much to accomplish with the client in such a short time.  Metrics are the only thing that seem to be important.  The intro script is too long, and saying thank you so much five times during your call is a bit much.  This job is too stressful, and the environment feels like you are always in a rush.  "

If you love being over worked and pushed to the max then this is the place for you.,Relationship Banker,"Can\'t believe I stayed in a company that cares about nothing but goals for so long. There is no work life balance. The more you know the worst you will get treated. ""Eyes in the sky"" the most heard phrase you will hear. You are watched. No room to be human. You are constantly monitored. Lunch breaks will be skipped because there is no staff. Management has no sense of what is happening. Pressure is real. Looks like a solid company but you are constantly in the wrong. Management does not care and are only out to look for their own. Do not join this company. It only looks good from a bird\'s eye view. You are just a stat or a number. "

It\xe2\x80\x99s amazing how many people are willing to sit in an office all day long and do paperwork they hate doing for a company that underpays and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate them.

They prioritize overall health and well being. It is a great company to work for. The only reason I will have to leave is because they are not offering a permanent remote role, and I have been in a remote role for nearly 2 years now. I am unable to return to the financial center as I am relocating so I will have to find a different job, but overall I truly wish I could stay with the bank. "
Bank-of-America,1fkn50e5u269p001,1,Go work literally anywhere else,Relationship Banker,"Working for this company destroyed me mentally and physically. Bank of America only cares about selling and pushing products to people. In the beginning they make it seem that there is zero pressure but once you finish training they throw you to the wolves. Management uses \xe2\x80\x9ctraining\xe2\x80\x9d tactics to micromanage you and nitpick everything you do until they\xe2\x80\x99re vision of perfection is you pushing products to people at every turn. My management would actively listen to my conversation and when they concluded, they\xe2\x80\x99d come over and tell me everything I did wrong. Not to mention staffing is a nightmare, some branches are working with 3 or 2 people total and that\xe2\x80\x99s with people working OT\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6"
Bank-of-America,1fkms6guou1hp801,5,A good place to work !!,Relationship Banker,Bank of America is amazing but I left because I realized it wasn't the career I wanted to pursue. I loved working here at first but after I was moved to a different branch things kind of went downhill for me. Management are lenient they definitely give you the benefit of doubt so don't mess that up. They consider anyone even if you don't have a college degree so THAT is just sweet !

Bank-of-America,1fkj705ofs7bq802,5,"Excellent Company, hard to move up",Senior Quality Analyst,"Working at this company has really taught me what benefits are and they have a TON! They encourage you to use your benefits and paid-time off with ability to purchase more is unbeatable. The schedule I have and the job duties are pretty normal and not stressful. Management has been great with maintaining a life-work balance and helping you with whatever you need. The only downside I have encountered is moving up the ladder. It's all about networking and not so much about your abilities. If you are good with networking, then you will have no issues. However, if networking is an ability you havent acquired yet then you should consider practicing it. Other than that, I have no complaints about working for Bank of America. Very inclusive and judgement free work environment."
Bank-of-America,1fkj17tea3ode000,3,People do not last working here.,Financial Solutions Advisor,You are  trying to open up bank and brokerage accounts all while collecting as much assets as possible in each. Management wants you to sell but has over the top compliance rules which prevent sales.

They do not value loyal employees. Unless your shoving digital down angry peoples throats. Good luck with you high turnover rate ! This company is slowly going down the drain! Managers find a way to motivate your team other than manipulating them and threatening to fire them over minuscule things. People who are not in the field don\xe2\x80\x99t know what these calls do to you. The job is extremely stressful and the managers don\xe2\x80\x99t make it any better I like the job but the manager ehh!

Bank of America support a diverse and inclusive culture which is very important to me. Management can make or break a position and I've had the pleasure of having fantastic management within my treasury rolls for implementation and technical consultants.  I can only speak for the Chicago teams but I'm working with the People Partners across the country seem to have similar cultures with management. Not to say the roles are not challenging as Bank of America has had their hardships in the past with work-life balance but they've made great strides and over the past four years and work-life balance has been greatly improved.

It was great to learn new things but because of the size of the company you will be doing that for as long as you are there. Day to day tasks get very repetitive and after some time boring. I only got to meet few people that were sitting next to me other then that there were over 200 employees just on my floor. You are just a small part of the huge machine. They fire and hire people all the time. They will not give you pay increase because its better for them to fire you and hire cheaper. The good thing is that if you are looking for a job and don't care about doing same thing all the time then it might fit you in well.

Bank-of-America,1fjrtk6v1u1am801,3,Not a bad workplace but depending on your position can be very toxic ,Video Client Services Specialist 1,"At first work place was fun an exciting and actually made you push and wanted to do better to advance but after my first year honestly  it honestly felt as if management would go out of their way to give you write ups that randomly comes out of no where and you have no way to dispute them, which then makes it so you can\xe2\x80\x99t advance to a different department which is just deflating. "
Bank-of-America,1fjr31405t4b9802,3,Great benefits-Management can be great but also can micromanage,Small Business Consultant,Great benefits. Some great managers some not so great managers. If you have a manager that micromanages it can be tough. Overall great teammates and professional work.
Bank-of-America,1fjr2j04ls7n1802,1,Highly stressful unrealistic expectations ,Relationship Banker,The money and benefits are good but the overall stress of the job is not. Unrealistic goals placed on employees. Care too much about clients perceptions and not enough about the mental health of employees. 
Bank-of-America,1fjom1i37u1am801,3,"Okay program, not sure about the room for growth",FSA Program ,"This program is split into about three parts. Begins with virtual licensing with later transfer to a an in person role in a financial center, and then to be placed in the Merrill office. Thus far the role seems fairly simple, however the program is not robust and there does not seem to be many transferrable skills from this role into another."

This is and was the single most important thing to me and I will be forever grateful to B of A. In  addition to that, they really just take care of their employees.

Company had a strong focus on digital integration and adversely affected the amount of walk in traffic.  Upper management soon required calling current clients to ""invite"" them in since the lobby was typically empty except to see tellers, complain, or handle a problem.   It gets worse when the branch is typically understaffed, putting more stress on the employees that are present"
Bank-of-America,1fjcpr6hso1mu800,2,I really have grown to hate it here,Customer Service,They micromanage your eveery breath now thye dont care about the mental health of its employees and they willl run you away from them . Its a puppy mill

Bank-of-America,1fja4guipu234802,3,"It wasn't about customer service anymore it was sell, sell, sell",Sales and Service Specialist,"A typical day at work was working with the older folks, assisting with their overdrawn checking accounts. The bulk of our clientele were the 70-90's crowd. You know back in the Gianini days.. The hardest part of the job was that customer service wasn't first. It was all about what i could sell them. I did not like that and that is why i took early retirement at age 52. Couldn't take it anymore. It was like being in a pressure cooker.  Also most regional management had never worked in a b anking center and put into effect new policy and procedur4es all the time. I wish they would have had to sit face to face with a customer and tell them that the fee reversal tool wouldn't refund their overdraft fee.  Shall i go on????"

Bank-of-America,1fj5c860eu23q801,3,Not bad but could be better. ,Fraud Analyst,You have to do more than needed on a call that's within a short time. Metrics are priority and not realistic. Nice and helpful people but training material needs to be better. Good benefits and pay. Only 30 min lunch which is not enough time even if you bring a lunch.

I have learned a lot about how accounts work and some insight on how to handle finances. It is a very demanding, high stress, draining place though. Very low on employees so we are worn thin. I will say the culture and relationships with fellow employees and management are great. Benefits and compensation are great as well."
Bank-of-America,1fj3nmgd2oc9v800,1,Hostile work environment ,Customer Service Representative,I loved working for this company until they allow favoritism and they micro manage and stress you out. The only thing good about to as the benefits. That\xe2\x80\x99s it

Bank-of-America,1fj19pg4dnq2f800,3,It really all depends on your manager.,Sr. Client Service Representative,When I started I had one of the best managers in the whole building. Then there was a shift bid and I got one that is almost completely incompetent. The calls are beyond stressful and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had work related mental health struggles until now. They are understanding for the most part. The benefits are great. 
Bank-of-America,1fj17lu4du1lk800,5,Loved working for BOA ,Customer Service Representative,Managers and employees were so friendly and always willing to help if you had a question. It is a lot of information to learn but I feel if you apply yourself at this job not only is there opportunity for advancement but a career that you can stick with untill retirement. The money and incentives were amazing and give you a chance to be very successful!

Bank-of-America,1fitflebet4ef801,2,Once a great company to represent.,Assistant Banking Center Manager,"Decades ago, before ""The Bank of America way"" was rolled out it was always pleasant to go to work and advancement was an option. Old school banking was soon done away with, it\'s now sales sales sales yet wait times are horrible and doing business with Bank of America is very difficult due to the companies greed and new focus. Very few locatons in Austin are still opened but very understaffed and their employees overworked. HR promises staffing and growth opportunities to current employees but never pull through."
Bank-of-America,1firvgts1hir4800,5,Great company to work for,Quantitative Analyst,"Internal mobility, there are plenty of opportunities for an internal transfer.Things are not moving fast which is understandable given the size of the company."
Bank-of-America,1firodtkls7f5802,2,Sub-Branch of the Fed,Senior Systems Analyst,"The bank has become a virtual sub-branch of the federal government ever since the ""too big to fail"" non-sense.  Everything is politics and bureaucracy, with little to no room left for actual innovation or tech work.  The culture is toxic.  This is not the company it was 20 or even 10 years ago. "
Bank-of-America,1fiqq22ubsa0o802,4,Good place to work in,Trade Operations Specialist,"They really care about their employees, at the pandemic times they were so generous with everything, special child care programs to everyone, they even were the first to shut down branches for the safety of their staff, they even till now do not compromise about the safety of their staff, overall they are a good conpany to work with."
Bank-of-America,1fiphjgrru423800,5,Consistency sustainable growth,CMO Marketing/CLMS Testing,"I appreciate working at Bank of America, great management team. Workplace culture is great. Supports Handicapped needs of employees and clients. Good benefit package."
Bank-of-America,1finckkipnpqa802,4,Diversity is not represented ,Escalation Manager,"There needs to be a cultural melting pot. Management does not represent the full population of all Americans. Too many changes, and not enough stability. "
Bank-of-America,1filjrnm3t4lq800,5,Great company and cares about their employees ,Teller,I learned so much and enjoyed working with all my teammates! Everyone was friendly and wanted you to succeed. Only thing was there was always a constant change of teammates. 
Bank-of-America,1filcopfdu423802,4,Call Center Agent,Call Center Customer Service Representative,pretty normal call center job. Come in log on take calls customers are pretty rude but hey I understand. You basically tell people you have to hold their check for 2 weeks even tho we already got it basically because the bank wants to make money off of it. Pretty annoying. 
Bank-of-America,1fijil7hmu423802,4,"Job security, culture",Mortgage underwriter,"The bank provides so much opportunity. However losing work from home will be really really bad. The ceo has always done such a great job, but I'm scared now for return to office, I'm not sure what's going to happen."
Bank-of-America,1fij5vrksnph6802,2,okay,Preferred Client Services Representative II,Even if you do everything right for the client. And the client makes you low on the survey. Even after the manager listen to the call and says you did everything right. they will still make it againest you.
Bank-of-America,1fiiclisou2bk800,3,Goos team orientation ,Customer Service Representative,"It was ok. Could have paid more. Micromanaging at an all time high. Calls back to back, which is to be expected. I did enjoy the team morale. Lots of company game days."
Bank-of-America,1fifue1u6oca1800,2,Stressful and underpaid,Bankruptcy Operations Team Manger,"The job was stressful. You are constantly worried about if you are going to be the next one laid off. After every round of layoffs, the current employees have to take on more work with no additional compensation, over and over again. The structure for raises only allows for minimal raises unless you are one of the top 1% of the employees. Constantly being told there is no money for bonuses, meanwhile the CEO is getting multi-million dollar bonuses every year and every quarter employees are asked to join a call where they are told how phenomenal the company is doing financially. The one good thing I can say about working there is that the people who I worked with, both peers and direct reports were amazing people and people I still call my friends."
Bank-of-America,1fifpc7fm2v6n000,3,Stressful when understaffed,Relationship Banker,"Angry customers with a lot of turnover with management. The good thing about working here is the business hours, but overall very stressful environment."
Bank-of-America,1fif4v196u37p802,4,Wonderful benefits and care for employees ,Client Service Representative,"I\xe2\x80\x99ve been with the company for several years while a great place to work at it is fast paced and goal oriented. They do care for employees and clients but, as with any company one works for, there are pros and cons. While I do enjoy most of the client interactions I have on a daily basis I do deal with client complaints about lack of staffing, location closures, no drive thru etc. I show empathy and direct them to a manager for any additional feedback and/or questions. While clients perceive lack of staff at my location we are considered \xe2\x80\x9cfully staffed\xe2\x80\x9d but w/ the few locations around that are closed we\xe2\x80\x99ve become a lot busier. It is difficult to finish and/or have time to do required training modules because everyone wants to leave so abruptly at close. We come in sometimes 45 minutes to an hour before opening but there are tasks to do as well as morning \xe2\x80\x9chuddles\xe2\x80\x9d before we open thus making it hard to get individual training, emails etc finished. For the most part one can feel extremely rushed. Also at least every other day there is some kind of computer and/or equipment issues as well as going offline or freezing problems while helping clients. Clients are understanding, for the most part, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look good when technical problems arise. Pros are excellent starting pay with a couple of weeks vacation at the get go. Great benefits w/ a lot of options to choose from. The hours are wonderful except I heard they may change them to be later in some states and/or major cities. All in all I think the pros outweigh the cons so it depends on you individually if this is a company"
Bank-of-America,1fid17j7gn52s802,5,Great company,Call Center Specialist,"Great company with great benefits. Call center was very demanding. The stress ate away at me. The pay was great, benefits-incomparable, very professional and structured. "
Bank-of-America,1fich73aft51v802,5,Awesome Company.  Meritocracy,Senior Vice President,I spent almost 12 years at BOA and loved every moment of my time there. The company has a great culture of meritocracy--they reward the people based on merit not tenor.
Bank-of-America,1fibklpnrn52s800,5,Enjoyed working here,Customer Experience Manager,I enjoyed working for the company. A typical day was filled with helping customers and working with team leads. Management was competent and diligent. The culture is not for the lazy!
Bank-of-America,1fibfutl4t51v802,4,Holidays off,Fianancial Center Manager,Stress level too high because you\xe2\x80\x99re working on multiple task and expected to exceed all performance metrics although you never have sufficient time to complete task.
Bank-of-America,1fib6ujjrnpll802,1,stay clear. They use you and pay slave wages,Credit Solutions advisor,"They continue to put more work on you while ""revising"" every 30 days or so the commission pay, which is cut every time. The support positions within the company are always reduced so you are left waiting to talk to someone because the staff has been cut. This goes from processing, to IT, to HR. Its almost like they are in a race to reduce as much staff as possible to keep their costs down. The reason they do this is because they are super focused on BofA stock price. The more profit,means less employees needing to be paid. As a loan officer they completely eliminated monthly commissions and replaced it with quarterly bonuses that instead were in the thousands are now in the hundreds. My income was cut a good 85% once this happened. When they removed the commissions 99% of all the loan officer nationwide ended up quitting and this had nothing to do with the pandemic, although it happened during the last 12 months.   They are driven to hire fresh new college graduates with little pay for what they do. "
Bank-of-America,1fiaod4tgu1sk802,4,Loved It,Customer Service Representative,Bank of America was a great place to work and the training program was top notch.  I just hated being confined to the phones and an adherence schedule but that is the call center life... 
Bank-of-America,1fia0s6vlnpll801,2,System issuses constantly ,Fraud Claims Specialist,They will let you go thru no fault of your own because they can\xe2\x80\x99t get there system to work I had received : computers none ever worked stated quarantined 
Bank-of-America,1fi9pic9eo1fk800,1,Terrible ,Collections Specialist,This Bank has great benefits and the managers are good but that\xe2\x80\x99s it. DO NOT WORK HERE! They barely want to train you. They care more about getting people on the phone then actually training them to do a good job! It\xe2\x80\x99s terrible! Then when you ask for help they want to give you push back! My team had to practically BEG for more help to do a job that they FORCED US TO DO! We had to train for an entirely new department! BEWARE! They will have you train for another department( which is not in the job description) with little and unhelpful training!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! WORK HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
Bank-of-America,1fi9pfiu5npll801,5,Busy and productive workplace with great coworkers,Supervisor,Busy and fun place to work. Manager at the time was energetic and encourages workers to do well and grow in the company. Not a lot of vacation and sick days.
Bank-of-America,1fi8rgc5ko1fe802,3,Depends on direct management ,Relationship Banker,They care mostly about numbers and sales but if you\xe2\x80\x99re lucky enough to get a good manager they will help you and get you there. Benefits and compensation are great.
Bank-of-America,1fi3poretu1ns800,4,Great Company with room for advancement ,Support Services Associate,"The job is overall great. As long as you meet production quotas then you\xe2\x80\x99re fine. BOA has satisfactory benefits, work/life balance, and opportunity to grow. As far as the pay it\xe2\x80\x99s higher than most of the financial institutions I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked for. "
Bank-of-America,1fi2tpk2do1fk800,2,Not inclusive and not respectful,Associate | Financial Advisor Development Program,Pay disparities and diversity hires put bonuses in the pockets of management. Leadership found to be violating DNC regulations. Compliance reads off the FAs who were let go for violations creating a fear mindset that you could be next. They will be sure to blemish your record even if they are wrong in doing so. Not worth working for if you actually want to serve your clients. It's not about helping clients it's about how they can make the most money. Just go in knowing you are always replaceable. 
Bank-of-America,1fi2jl7f7u1sk801,4,There are many lines of business,Business Technical Analyst,There are many lines of business to work under so move around. Client protection has a really good culture and community of people. Treasury Services depends on what umbrella you are under.
Bank-of-America,1fi0ti8mvn52s802,3,Its tough,RB,"Good luck, alot of enthusiasm in the beginning but now its all micro management on the retail side. I mean alot of micro management, if you are okay with that, then great."
Bank-of-America,1fi04oa1at51v800,4,Great benefits ,Financial Center Assistant Manager,"Amazing benefits all around. Vacation time, flair holidays, disability benefits, child care benefits and the list goes on and on. Not many company\xe2\x80\x99s provide such great benefits. Pay is good and work hours are pretty good as well. Wish we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to work 6 days but even then they won\xe2\x80\x99t make u work more than 40 hrs. If your looking for OT doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bother they don\xe2\x80\x99t like to allow it unless pressing circumstances."

Bank-of-America,1fhtv6jb2t5dg800,2,It used to be great,Credit solutions advisor,"Took a job as a credit solutions advisor and was basically misinformed (nicest way of putting it) about what the expectations would be. I came from a job on the desk, taking this job as a loan officer (now csa) because it was supposed to be less stress and more straight forward. Management is OK on the branch level, I loved my manager at my old branch and my current manager is OK but upper management seems to have forgotten how to keep their employees motivated. They have a habit of promoting people to mid/upper level management positions who are completely in over their heads and then they start piling on additional tasks because they likely are getting pestered by those above them. It's to the point that there really isn't enough time in the day to complete what they expect to be done. "
Bank-of-America,1fhsao7c03oep001,1,Great for the experience. ,Debt Collector,"Poor management, horrible work environment, the take your pto, no room for growth, favoritism, was a definite waste of my time. 10/10 would not recommend. "

Bank-of-America,1fhj1ef2ut49t802,4,Great Company to develop skills/experience in With Great People,Loan  Control Specialist,"If you are straight out of college, I highly recommend getting a job at bank of America, you will gain great experience and learn a lot of useful skill. Work load will increase a lot faster than pay, where the money paid no longer justifies the extra work. It best to work there for 2-4 years then use that experience to try to move to another position in the company or, move to a different company. But the company, environment, managers and people are great!"
Bank-of-America,1fhgovhnns9uh801,3,No work life balance,QA Lead,No work life balance.. apart from this not a bad company.. salary and benefits are great. its just alot of competition from vendor contractors who are working anywhere from 12 to 16 hr/day.. management expects the same from everyone and if you are not doing the same then you are not giving you 100%

Bank-of-America,1fhen3gedo2id802,1,Terrible management.,CSR - Customer Service Representative,"Difficult job. What made it worse was management. They really saw employees just as objects and not human beings. Workplace culture was so demoralizing, every single member of staff wanted to quit."
Bank-of-America,1fhe8pu1hpiba800,4,Great health benefits,Teller,Supportive atmosphere throughout the pandemic. Awesome IVF coverage and reimbursement. Wish acupuncture was covered as well. Hardest part of the job is the long lines and angry customers. Typical day at work is very repetitive and monotonous. I do not understand hiring new people instead of promoting within. Waste of time training and resources. I also believe they can do a better job of placing employees near their home addresses.
Bank-of-America,1fhctonces9uh802,3,Okay workplace ,Relationship Banker,Was not along my career path so of course I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for the work I did.

Bank-of-America,1fhcg26r4u2l5800,2,No career advancement opportunities ,Advocate,The benefits are the best part. But everyone who works there and who has left all know this. Company does not have any remote positions available. Communication from leaders to employees needs improvement 
Bank-of-America,1fhbq7eemt66d802,4,Great worknlife balance,Relationship Banker,"Not a lot of communication on changes within the company, especially past year with Covid. Promotions are slow and take some time. Culture is great tho, good work life balance and Great benefits. "

Bank-of-America,1fh9fj737t66d802,1,No work life balance ,Operations Specialist,"There are three ways to describe:Underpaid, overworked, and unappreciated ! This job experience was worst than working at fast food. Remittance process center is too stressful."
Bank-of-America,1fh9aaeqkt66d800,3,Used to be proud to represent the but they took advantage of their loan officers. ,Credit solutions advisor ,I was a platinum performer for many years. The transition to the CSA role and the fact they would not let us switch to a different position after promising us multiple times we could was the last straw. They expect loan officers to pick up all the slack since we are customer facing and don\xe2\x80\x99t provide any support. You could do 30 applications and yet miss your goal cause nothing closed.

Bank-of-America,1fh72c5bru1hk800,5,Everyone on the team were the best to work with. Even the are manager was amazing!,Digital Media Intern,I would work there if my schedule lets me. It's hard to juggle both school and work. I know people who did both like a master's program and still find time for everything else. Pay could be a little better though
Bank-of-America,1fh6t7o43n518802,4,Great coworkers,Customer Service Representative,While working at Bank of America as a Customer Service Represntative you are usually under stress since you are taking calls all day every day with no downtime. Clients are very unappreciative of your job. Managers and coworkers are very attentive and try to support you as much they can. You have both shift and language differential which is a plus.
Bank-of-America,1fh6m4a3po2if801,5,Fun workplace ,Customer Service Representative,Pay is good lots of incentives work in the call center ajd it\xe2\x80\x99s very easy going good pace about ten minutes between calls pretty consistently write up policy is great very hard to get yourself fired very understanding 
Bank-of-America,1fh6ea1o1o2id802,3,You get to interact with customers and tget are cool,Merchant Teller,Its an ok job that's it not longterm I wouldn't say atleast. I feel like the pay should be increased. This is a good job for college or fresh out of high school
Bank-of-America,1fh675of7u2l5802,3,Good company but steer clear of the call center ,Preferred Relationship Specialist,BOA is a great company to work for. However the call center is toxic. I worked there for almost 5 years and it was mentally exhausting. Standards are too high and no matter what you do there is always feedback on something to do better.

Bank-of-America,1fh4h547nn518801,5,Great benefits!,Customer Service Representative,Bank of America is great if you want to be in the finance industry and aren\xe2\x80\x99t stuck on a set department. I started in customer service but was able to transfer to small business then fraud. Lots of room to grow your career!
Bank-of-America,1fh3j4os6t499801,3,Cool,Banker,It\xe2\x80\x99s an ok job if you are looking to get inducted to financial services. They offer you free banking accounts to so that makes it even better. The pay is good 
Bank-of-America,1fh1n3cieo2id800,4,A strong culture but limited upside,Small Business Banker,"Overall the bank is an outstanding organization which is why it's been in business for so long. Leadership and all departments work together and are extremely profitable. Strong training and manager support. The downside is in the long run, especially with moving up the ladder, may not provide opportunities to grow. Compensation is tied to how the bank actually does rather than your performance, and many factors are out of your control such as how your territory performs or whether a client leaves the bank. Your salary will be much lower than competitors."
Bank-of-America,1fgu68il4u1hk801,2,Virtue signaling,VP Operations Manager,"Benefits are great, but that\xe2\x80\x99s about it. The company is more worried about virtue signaling, being social justice warriors, and the way they are perceived in the public\xe2\x80\x99s eye than actually producing for their customers. As a former employee and current customer it is much more important to have people in the role that best aligns with their abilities and skill sets. However, they are more worried about going along with the current social experiments then they are providing quality products and services for their customers. Executives will tell their leadership team to say and do things in a very specific manner, but when confronted or questioned, they will lie right to your face and tell you that your boss is a liar. I.e. management is told they can not rate more than 10% of their people as exceeding expectations. This has been a normal practice for over 12 years, and they have actually rejected year-end reviews because they did not meet these guidelines. When asked about it by individual contributors, the executives told them all management were flat out lying, and we\xe2\x80\x99re never told there was a guideline to year and reviews. It is a great place to work if you were more concerned about warm and fuzzy feelings then you are providing quality service and being treated equally."
Bank-of-America,1fgsjvnmto1e9802,3,Pay is good but it’s a grind,Bilingual Client Services Representative II,The pay is good but customers wear thin and it\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating seeing poor people getting punished for their situation while the rich get the red carpet treatment.
Bank-of-America,1fgs09sqsn59l801,3,General call center ,Wealth Management Associate,"Overall the reason I stay is because of what I get paid.  I am a glorified switch board operator.  You are just a number and a statistic.  Rarely are there occasions I actually get to do anything.  They micromanage so much that you can\xe2\x80\x99t actually do what you\xe2\x80\x99re hired to do. There\xe2\x80\x99s not much room for movement unless somebody leaves or moves to another position. On the upside: the health insurance benefits, sick time, and vacation time is up to par.  The PTO you have to purchase and you are limited to 40 hours. "
Bank-of-America,1fgpu4kq1sa5l800,4,Financial stability and reputation ,Instructor II,"BAC overall is a very good company to work for. Reputation is key and theirs is pretty solid. However, I think more investment in training Frontline staff is important, and not just virtually."
Bank-of-America,1fgp834ses7ho802,4,Good pay ,Customer Service Representative,The pay and benefits are great however don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s worth people screaming at you all day long & saying awful things when you\xe2\x80\x99re just doing your job 
Bank-of-America,1fgp5eii0o1dp802,5,Fun Place to Work ,Customer Service Representative,Good Place to work if you like interacting with clients and are organized. Good opportunities to move up if you show ambition and performance.  Only thing that can be negative are the long lines of clients you have to help when you don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough tellers to help you 
Bank-of-America,1fgov79tas9sg801,3,Fun team but hard to advance,Client Service Representative,Love my direct manager and team but upper management sucks. Very hard to advance into another role and a lot of employees were held back from being promoted during the pandemic. 
Bank-of-America,1fgn5mtv8o1e9802,1,Great at first,Associate,Training could be better. Often feel left out to burn by myself. And trusting people here you definitely should be aware. Everyone is looking to throw you under a bus.
Bank-of-America,1fgmgkjehs9sg800,4,"Great benefits, job stability, lots of responsibilities. ",Client Service Representative,"Working here for a few years now and while I\xe2\x80\x99m grateful to have been able to transition to a work from home position during the pandemic, both roles are definitely mentally exhausting. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to find a work life balance especially as a parent trying to achieve personal goals at the same time. I am not in a fulfilling role and ultimately feel a disconnection from my work. "
Bank-of-America,1fgleugm3o1e9800,2,Manager don't care about employees ,Customer Service Representative,"Manager has zero management skills. Never positive & angry. Rude to customers, it's all about numbers. Never have enough employees to cover shifts, horrible place to work at."
Bank-of-America,1fgkijv8tn5d5800,3,"Pushy sales tactics, constant micro-management",Relationship Manager,"Good benefits with decent base pay and incentive potential.  Constant micro-management can be overwhelming.  Management does not care about helping clients with their financial priorities, just want bankers to shove mostly un-needed products down the throats of clients.  Bankers are expected to pick up slack from lack of tellers while meeting sales goals.  Push clients out of the financial centers with digital products and ATM services, then want us to cold call customers and invite them into the banking center.  "
Bank-of-America,1fgjp378kn5cv801,5,Great Benefits,Analyst,I enjoyed everyone I worked with as far as Management goes. I can't say that for all of Management because I have heard of some rough ones as well. My experience has been great though. Benefits change each year. You start with 2 weeks vacation but depending on your years of service your weeks of vacation increase. You can also buy a week of vacation...meaning they take a small dollar amount from your paycheck to pay for that week. 
Bank-of-America,1fgiji1uapi92800,5,Diversity and Inclusion ,Team Lead,"There\xe2\x80\x99s a culture at Bank of America that is very inclusive and there is 360 degree coaching, meaning, you can coach any hierarchy. It was also fun working in back office. "

It was too busy for me with back to back calls the entire shift, no matter which day or time of day it was. The trainers and management were great. The job just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a good fit for me "
Bank-of-America,1fgespq9uu428801,1,Non,Fraud Claims Specialist,The calls were quite overwhelming throughout the day because you\xe2\x80\x99ll be speaking to customers that are extremely upset about their accounts being \xe2\x80\x9ccompromised\xe2\x80\x9d. Initiating fraud claims and working them .
Bank-of-America,1fgdpomb5u412802,1,"Poor management, 100+ calls a day",Fraud Prevention Representative,"I was so excited to start my career at bofa. Training was very informative and positive but once you got to taking calls no support at all. No one would answer when sending messages for help, had two separate managers in the year I was there and both rarely reached out or had any interest in their teams except to make their numbers look good for big boss. Customers constantly yelling at you over bank procedures out of your control paired with horrible management and support ultimately lead to my quitting. Overworked, over stressed, no meaning in the job except a paycheck. Little room for advancement high turnover of new hires (of the 14 people in my new hire class, 6 made it to the full year). They don\xe2\x80\x99t care about you."
Bank-of-America,1fgb41c3fsa1l800,5,Productive ,Customer Service Representative PT,I'm made to feel as a part of a family. We're on this ship together. Keep it simple with as little redundancy.I'm on the same page with the company.
Bank-of-America,1fgarht3ahie4800,4,Good Benefits. Room to advance,Claims analyst II,New to this job. Can be quite stressful with so much to learn. A lot does not seem very user friendly. The benefits seem to be quite generous. Good management and training.

Bank-of-America,1fg9luoais7mv800,4,Excellent workplace ,Client Service Representative,"It was great working at BOA, but my site manager was not helping with making it convenient for  me.  I wanted to get a transfer to a different branch because I was facing several commute challenges, instead she made it difficult for me even though I worked hard to keep a good performance. "
Bank-of-America,1fg9lo3s53kji001,3,Room to grow but dependent on your direct leaders. ,Relationship Banker,Started off very happy with the job and excited for the future. Covid forced me to \xe2\x80\x9ctemporarily\xe2\x80\x9d transfer locations. Management did not handle covid very well and client frustrations are taken out on front line employees. We still get blamed for bad feedback regarding management decisions. Lack of support from Market leaders and daily policy updates make it difficult to provide positive client experience 
Bank-of-America,1fg8cetfou412802,1,Great benefits ,Customer Service Representative,Poor management with no ability to grow unless you are apart of the cliques. Sales driven even pushing products that customers don't need or shouldn't have. No balance between work and life.
Bank-of-America,1fg7s5loeu428800,3,Could've been better,Lien Specialist,"Not much room to grow. Minimal opportunities to advance were given to a select few even if you were great at what you did, had to be a ""favorite"". The pay definitely could\'ve been much better."

Bank-of-America,1fg78hrnthie4801,5,Great upper mgmt to learn from,Team Manager,Great company to work for. Able to buy extra pto time and also the culture was awesome. Had great upper management that you could consistently learn from. 
Bank-of-America,1fg73ui83pi92802,4,Not bad while I was there ,Interim Client Advocate,Overall Bank of America is a great company to work for. The benefits they offer are very hard to find anywhere else. The only part I disliked of the company and it was the small business department in brea to be exact was that even though they tell you about all these job opportunities to grow they won\xe2\x80\x99t actually select you based on merit and experience. It\xe2\x80\x99s more about who you know and suck up to.
Bank-of-America,1fg5ml6p2o15m801,3,Good pto,Teller,"PTO was easily earned, management was hard to deal with. No assistance really provided when help was requested. Customers always treat you very bad and managers do not do anything about it"

Bank-of-America,1fg0v4p48hie4802,3,A good place to work,Wealth Management Field Support Representative,This company over all is a great place to work. I would suggest not working in the call center as the schedules are very strictly enforced and there is no break between calls
Bank-of-America,1fg0bgogfhie4802,1,The kind of company that hides behind scripts and verbiage,Client Service Representative II,"This is one of those companies that is very robotic and procedural when dealing with legitimate customer concerns. I can think of several examples where a customer's situation should have been examined more thoroughly before telling me to stick to the talking points. Speaking of the customers though, while there are some extremely pleasant ones that you speak to over the phone, the majority of them are either stupid, entitled, or both and I do not suffer fools gladly. I had zero problems putting people in their place when they needed it."
Bank-of-America,1ffu5beops7mv802,2,Fair pay. Terrible work/life balance. Senior leadership out of touch with front line.,Branch Manager,Front line unappreciated. Staffing not appropriate.

Bank-of-America,1ffqlos2tu428800,1,Mortgage work is soul crushing. (Plano) ,Lead Operations Representative ,Everyone is over worked with zero support from upper management. Frequently cussed out by underwriters and upper management sides with the offender. Frequent overtime and even some work on the weekends. Everyone is miserable. Avoid. 
Bank-of-America,1ffqcnopahie4800,1,Don't do it ,Mortgage Loan Specialist II,"After the interview I thought it'd be similar to my experience working for another large bank. I was wrong. I understand that with COVID we are adjusting to a new way of life but honestly it's been over a year and by now a lot of kinks should have been worked out. My training experience was awful. The beginning of it was good but the coaches have a habit of being rude and also giving misinformation pertaining to the job. When you call them out on it they either don't acknowledge you or soeak to you like you're ignorant or unintelligent. A lot of micro-aggressions, bad attitides, and patronizing. One of the people in my class even started crying after a coach spoke to them in a really rude manner. I will never open an account with BofA and don't recommend working here. Also, there are a ton of system problems you have to work through. I'm not used to that. The previous bank I worked for did not have this problem on such a large scale. And servicing the customer was hard because the coaches would just tell you to transfer them when you knew they weren't supposed to be but because the coaches don't take the time to listen before they're telling you what to do. I've had a few dozen instances where I'd be interrupted while asking a question, spoken over, told incorrect information, etc. There was also a lot of time wasted due to unpreparedness and troubleshooting. For Home Loans the amount of work you're expected to do vs the pay does not match. And there is no bonusing. Their excuse was because we weren't expected to sale anything there is no incentivw for bonus; however, the previous"
Bank-of-America,1ffp2g501hie4802,4,Great company to work for,Lockbox Clerk,"The work was very technical and rudimentary, which could get boring after a while. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great job for students or someone looking for supplemental income. The managers are flexible and willing to work with your schedule, although the bourse seem rigid. "
Bank-of-America,1ffom0vgju428800,3,Fast paced environment / Difficult to advanced ,Relationship Banker,Good banking experience and training. Great health benefits. Mainly job duty is being a teller.

Bank-of-America,1ffj7sudso292802,3,Call center review ,Customer Service Representative,"It\xe2\x80\x99s honestly a really well paid job, great benefits as well.My issue was that they wanted you to take 5min or less with the clients. So you would have to take the call, and give them information on how to resolve the issue themselves. The customers hated that because they had waited so long for the call to be answered just so they get redirected to their mobile app.I would always take my time truly helping the clients and I would constantly get training to improve, meaning rush the clients off the call."

Bank-of-America,1ffg0hcatu412800,3,It was ok just not for me.,Online Banking Representative,Worked in the branch as a teller and then in the call center. As a teller you are pushed to meet unrealistic sales goals and in the call center you are pushes to meet survey goals. The surveys are hard to meet because you must keep your call time low while still helping the customers with various issues.
Bank-of-America,1fffuq6skhie4802,3,Teamwork ,SR Fraud Analyst/ Supervisor,I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go in critically but the management is decent some days some days not so decent.  My teammates were very cool and felt like an extension of family.
Bank-of-America,1fffq07tvu412800,1,micro management to the fullest degree,Relationship Manager,the benefits are great if you can put up with lousy management and being micro managed to death. Un realistic goals and new flavor of the month worthless gadget they want you to push like life plan to name a great example. management is horrendous and clueless. they would rather have behaviors rather than production and suck up kiss butt employees. Employees are also encouraged to rat each other out. pathetic use of time being asked to sit and cold call 20-25 people per day and pester them to come to bank while they tout being able to bank from home and use app and not come in to bank.

They do have lots of little extras to try to make it a nice place to work....like a coffee tea area with snacks, private phone areas for us to use, a nice cafeteria....but food is too expensive and not enough time to walk over, order, eat and get back.

You will work over 40 hours which is great in some areas but obviously takes away from your much needed down time from a job like this. It will give you a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day, because you know you\xe2\x80\x99ve done everything yourself, but it wears you down quicker then quicksand. My branch manager was amazing, but above him/her, they don\xe2\x80\x99t care and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get anywhere with people who don\xe2\x80\x99t value you. "

It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t always this bad which is why I stayed for so long\xe2\x80\xa6 Turnover is high now and the company goals seem to be how to force out tenured higher-paid employees to replace them with younger (inexperienced) and lower-paid staff. If you like being micro-managed then this is definitely the place for you! "
Bank-of-America,1ff62ua2ht4e2800,3,Good experience,Teller,"Good experience. Some customers were very mean and disrespectful to tellers. Management was mostly good. Co-workers were nice. Pay was fair. Breaks were strict and you were told when to take a break or lunch, following state guidelines. "
Bank-of-America,1ff4ncha9u33u802,3,Too many hats ,Bank Teller,"Things may have changed since I worked there but, there were far too many hats to wear for the amount of compensation. The work/life balance was also pretty unreasonable... everyone is expected to work Monday through Saturday. The sales expectations for a teller were unreasonable - many regulars came in on a daily basis, along with commercial businesses, but that still counted towards your count. "
Bank-of-America,1ff36fhogu33u802,4,Great company terrible management ,Banker,There is a lot of politics at boa. You have to kiss the manager or market leader to be promoted. Market leaders tend to be judge-mental. The company is great the values are great management and politics suck. 
Bank-of-America,1ff28r4l3t4e2802,1, They switched my vacation and schedule while I was on vacation to make me a no call no show. Knowing I was off for surgery and not pleasure.,Fraud Analyst,Some departments and managers can be very nice but the company only helps who they feel fit their mold. If you\xe2\x80\x99re not the super outgoing type and willing to be the teachers pet type then they will make it very hard for you to keep your job.
Bank-of-America,1ff20ap53308t000,4,Productive and fast paced environment with potential to grow,Client Service Representative,Management always had an eye on employees to see who they could move up the ladder ASAP.

I loved the people/ my coworkers everything else is is not worth the time.  You are told you have to do extra to get ahead.  I worked for free, I worked weekends and did everything they asked but they don\xe2\x80\x99t care about their people.  It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get promoted if your don\xe2\x80\x99t know anyone and them salary gaps for women and people of color still exist.  You cannot speak your mind and are expected to fall in line whenever voluntold. "
Bank-of-America,1ff0kmbnft4ep801,4,Great place to work!,Fiduciary Tax Officer,This company has helped me to grow and expand my career. Fair to employees as long as you do your job and do it well. Benefits are great especially maternity leave which is 16 weeks for both mother or father.

Bank-of-America,1fenh01lvt4e2802,5,Productive and fun workplace,Customer Liaison,I had worked at a data center and the people from top to bottom were terrific.  I enjoyed going to work everyday and learned many things when I was there.

Otherwise, you should avoid being a Bank of America call center rep."

Bank-of-America,1fek9ilqmu33u802,2,Not for me,Sales Specialist,"Worked at a desk making sales calls all day from 9-5. Felt like I was trapped in jail. Didn't really care for the job. Objectively, I would think you are better off taking a job like this if you can't stand being alone. If you feel energized by people 24/7, you could be good at this job. Also, I think the industry is a bit boring for me. Again, if you are interested in learning about banking products and services, this could be for you. The job lacked any sort of variety. Then again, probably to be expected working in a bigger company vs. working at a smaller company where you take on responsibility in a variety of tasks. "
Bank-of-America,1fek0aef6t4e2801,5,Great place to work,Associate Operations Representative,"Good pay and raises. Good benefits including plenty of paid time off, sick days, and personal days. Great job security, plenty of support from supervisors. Overall highly recommend."

Bank-of-America,1fejj4lb4t4e2802,4,Great Company with awesome benefits,Relationship Banker,"I thoroughly enjoy working for BOA especially during the peak of the COVID outbreak. They make sure they provide for their employees and did everything they could to ensure we had our child care expenses paid for, emergency relief funds distributed to families in need and they also give you tuition reimbursement if you are pursing your degree in a field thats in line with the business. Depending on who you are managed under honestly depends on your promotions. There are many under qualified managers and assistant managers occupying those roles and it gets frustrating when you know you have the capability to thrive in that position but are a complete after thought. However, it also sucks that the starting wage is $20 per hour but us who've been there for years have had to work painstaking times and sometimes double what others have to reach $20 per hour and receive no raise."
Bank-of-America,1fejbeqs5t4ep802,5,Fun,Video Teller,I worked as a Video Teller for Bank of America. I loved it and miss it daily. There were a lot of opportunities to learn and grow. The benefits were amazing as well.

Bank-of-America,1fehb21tvo221802,5,A great place to work! Recognition and pay increases truly based on YOUR efforts!!,Customer Service Representative II,"I truly LOVED working at BofA. I worked hard, listened to my supervisors, and paid close attention to my coaches when there was something new integrated into the system. A lot of people didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay attention and ended up lost when it came time to using the new application in the system. and When I applied for another (higher) position, all of my hard work and dedication paid off, as I was awarded the position. The only reason that I ended up leaving was because of a life changing medical condition and I\xe2\x80\x99m no longer able to work. Such a huge bummer\xe2\x80\xa6."
Bank-of-America,1fef75qrdt4ep800,5,Excellent ,Financial Center Lending Officer,"I was a relationship manager then progressed to a loan officer. That\xe2\x80\x99s the good thing about a frontline role in the branch, you\xe2\x80\x99re exposed to many people and lines of business so you can make an informed decision about what type of career you\xe2\x80\x99d want to pursue. I had nothing but positive experiences with BOA and I\xe2\x80\x99m still a customer today. Love the technology. I\xe2\x80\x99d go back if offered the opportunity. Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have left! "

Some managers are very selfish and only care about their success and will choose favorites in their department, and will waste your time and make you apply and interview with an exec, it's terrible. If you get a good manager, which is rare, then it is worth it."
Bank-of-America,1fe72itift4d3800,5,bb,Executive Assistant,"Regardless of how frequently or in what manner your company conducts performance reviews, these meetings should benefit employees and managers alike.

Bank-of-America,1fe6m5h8do2dr801,5,"Great place to work, the benefits are unmatched. ",Virtual Client Associate,Very hard to move around. Managers have back door ways to HR to hold you back from other opportunities. Benefits are the best in the financial industry. 
Bank-of-America,1fe432l4lu38h800,4,Good benefits,Relationship Banker,"Good benefits, average pay, not nearly as strict as some other banks. If you get a good manager you will have a good experience, because it is a good environment overall. "
Bank-of-America,1fe42i5r2t4dh802,3,Its a great place to work if youre goodnat being fake and wearing a mask all day.,Sales Associate,BofA was a fantastic place to work at first. Over time the Camp chippewa vibe really set in. You can't ever say anything remotely bad about them or all of a sudden you're on every manager's radar. The pay is decent and the bonuses for my position (ACS) were unreasonably unreachable. They expect you to sell people into more debt making it seem like a great idea when its clearly not whats best. 
Bank-of-America,1fe2spttuu38h802,3,BOA review,Financial Analyst,"This company has pros and cons, and whether you will like working here depends on your personality. 1. Before reading the following things, here are the pros...amazing compensation, you won't be super stressed compared to other companies as banking is a slow moving machine (group/manager dependent as always), vacation time is excellent (in 2021 they added more vacation time). If you like remote work this is the place for you (I personally enjoy working with my teammates face to face so I struggle with this). Paternity/Maternity leave & vacation is best around, 16 weeks. Try finding that anywhere else, and you'll find this is rare. I'm very appreciative of this benefit and love how they promote it.2. Majority of groups within the bank that are salaried positions do not work in the same location. If you love remote work then you will not have a problem with this. I checked the organization chart for my division recently, and 100% of the salaried teams had 80%+ of their members in completely different locations (Charlotte, Kennesaw, Newark, Phoenix, Texas, Chicago, Jacksonville, etc.) If you want camaraderie and opportunities for team building outside of emails, you will not find satisfaction here. However, if you are in an operations environment (call center, helpdesk) then you will be with your team in the same location with a supervisor there as well.3. Every group's manager is different. You may have one that has aggressive expectations, or one that is extremely lax and isn't aggressive at all. You may have a manager that gets nothing done, or is the best in the world."
Bank-of-America,1fe2ovmg3t4dh802,4,Great company,"Recruiting Coordinator, Global Talent Acquisition","They are learning new responsibilities. The only issue is the background checks that candidates are required to complete. It takes a long time, and there are times when candidates and hiring managers get frustrated with the process."
Bank-of-America,1fe27bs4i3od8002,2,Big Wheel Keep on Turning ,Business Specialist,"all they care about is saving money and their shareholders. they write articles about diversity and employee wellness and how cutting edge they are and sure they might be on the corporate side. Definitely not on the branch side, absolutely no innovation all they require you is to push buttons instead of actually helping clients with their financial goals.  All talk no walk though as managers and market leaders still burn every young professional out. no ambition in the financial centers. ZERO innovation here, especially when they still provide no incentive cause of covid but bring back all associates from Work From Home. "
Bank-of-America,1fe1vmaslu38h802,5,Fun workplace and teammates and great pay and benefits,Digital Service Specialist,"I worked for the bank for 3 years, and I loved every bit of it. The employees make you feel very at home and quick to build work relationships with. The hours were great and they were always flexible with days off and vacation or sick time. I would have stayed and built a career out of it if COVID didn't happen and they did not force all employees to go remote. The turnover rate is not the best and they have new hires every 3-4 months. Your calls are all recorded and you are graded per call for time and quality. They hold a very high performance rate for their employees, which can be difficult at times especially dealing with bank accounts."

Bank-of-America,1fdvfjkq6u38h802,2,Toxic work environment,SEnior Team Manager,Spent 10 years toiling in that dark pit of despair. Management was horrible and the bureaucracy  was terrible. You honestly could not pay me to go back. IT only got worse as time went on. 
Bank-of-America,1fdvcp3udo2dr802,4,No advancement,Customer Service Representative,Typical call center with very little opportunity to get off the phones pushed constantly to take calls faster. Really no path to further your career. A decent job until you get to a job that you really want. High attrition rate.

Home loans department is falling apart with the new structure and changes in pay and obligations.

Bank-of-America,1fdt4v9q0u38h801,1,Sales organization with no heart,Relationship Manager,Everyone there is miserable. From top to bottom is just constant pressure. I had ptsd for about a year afterwards. Nothing is ever good enough. Goals are way out of reach 
Bank-of-America,1fdsq5te9t4d3800,3,Good company to work for if you are in the right team,Senior Analyst,"This bank being huge, it's like multiple organizations under one umbrella. So the work culture is different in different organizations. If you are in a good team with a good manager, you are lucky. Due to so many mergers, the work culture has changed a lot. It's a conservative company though it is striving to be modern. New leaders come all the time, and give the same rhetoric every time. Every body tries to fit into the corporate culture pretending to be a professional but they are not truly professional. Often you have to do things that don't make any sense at all. There is no way you can give negative feedback on bad managers and not face any repercussions- if you do you have to do it at your own risk. It's a biased environment (could be unintentional bias in some cases). You can grow only to a certain level and that too only if you're lucky enough to have good managers who would help you get the visibility. Otherwise you should be content with what you do and stay at the same level. Empathy for coworkers is very rare. There is more of selfishness than friendliness. There were great leaders but most of them have gone. Not easy to switch jobs within the company as you will have to let your manager know when you get an interview (so there is a fear of being treated badly if you don't get that job). If you get an interview, insist on talking to the team members to get an idea of the team culture."
Bank-of-America,1fdsjkmn7u38h802,2,A lot of Disappointing Potential,Relationship Manager Business Owner Specialist,"they really do not give alot of resources to employees to be able to succeed. the systems never work and if one issue gets fixed it is immediately replaced by another one. Branch managers always tend to bite off more than they can chew and are never available for you to get an override or review docs. I feel as if Management gets overloaded with work projects to where they don\'t have time to really focus one on one with the employees. they have created ""Specialist"" roles in order to give bankers a sense of where they want to get promoted but they are still treated as if we have to help every single client anyways while the real bankers are treated like tellers. Which is not what they are advertising. there is a very huge disconnect between corporate and the financial centers. both have their problems. While I like the path corporate is trying to take this company. the financial centers continue to stick to their old ways which is to help everyone and overload every associate with every transaction regardless of process or what job is being assigned to each employee. that being said every single time I have voiced my opinion to a leader, a market leader, and corporate itself. there is a blatant disregard for what I have to say and it is seen as me just making excuses and complaining. I really do like the product and the values this company has to offer its clients. the biggest issue is they provide limited resources to the employees to be able to service them. There is a sever lack of efficiency when it comes to the systems provided, and every process that you execute for the"

Bank-of-America,1fdif13onu23m800,2,Management culture from the 70s,Senior VP,"Management culture is very top-down (you do what you are commanded to do, you work when told to work, including weekends). Little empowerment, and little toleration for dissent or different opinions. Stress-level can be high. If you are the type of person who will stay in their initial  position, always agree with management, do your job, accept no annual raises or very small raises, then you will do fine in this culture. If you demonstrate talent and want to advance, get real raises, and move up the ladder, prepare yourself for a cut-throat culture where attacks can come from any angle and success is gained more by destroying your competitors than by demonstrating your own competence."
Bank-of-America,1fdgqqledsa4h802,5,Excellent Experience!,"Senior Financial Analyst, Regulatory Reporting","The bank hired me without any banking experience!  Because I worked hard, they worked hard to support me.  The theme throughout the company is Family Comes First!  This was important to me as a single mom.

Bank-of-America,1fcvrdnu6himt800,4,Overall okay,Finance Manager,"Lots of overly complicated processes and administrative finance roles to manage those processes. I\'ve had great managers and very bad managers which I think you can expect from any company. The workplace culture is very white male and white female dominated. Your success depends on your network. The hardest part of the job is that it has no intrinsic meaning for me but that is on me to find a career or job that is fulfilling. Many people seem to enjoy working here or at least they would never let it show if they didn\'t. It\'s all about keeping up appearances here.

BOA is very adamant to eventually go 100% back to the office once it's safe even if your team works in another location. 
Bank-of-America,1fcshke9docao802,3,Repetitive work & metrics driven,Client Service Representative,"You will take constant back to back calls from the start of your shift to the end.

This is your typical call center."

Break time was assigned, and management gets unhappy if using break time earlier or later. Paid Holidays, 3 weeks vacation and 10 day sick leave.Benefits are good, but still stressful.The job itself is nasty and takes all of your energy. People here who have been worked for 10 years and dont get promotion. I worked very hard but ended up getting anxiety and depression. Not worth. I only made 35K after tax. "
Bank-of-America,1fcn7sutsocao800,2,Micromanaging & Horrible Management,Teller,"You will have to clock out on your computer, even though you still have to work overtime so you don\xe2\x80\x99t get paid justly.

Then BofA Small Business is for you! They have looped SB into the consumer bank and as a result they have to follow the same rules / regulations as they do when interacting with consumers. It is absolutely asinine and makes zero sense.  There are so many steps and protocols to follow with everything we do, it's amazing we have time to sell.  Nothing is ever good enough and morale is at an all time low.  First time I have ever really hated a job.  "
Bank-of-America,1fcgrmnnct4mk800,4,Fun place to work,Fraud Analyst,BoA is a great place to work with many good benefits and incentives.One of the things i dislike there is the fact that everyone tries to micro manage.
Bank-of-America,1fceksim0t4mk800,3,Over worked under paid.,VP,Their labor model is to replace high paying senior associates with lower paid entry level personnel. At the same time doubling work loads on sr. workers with workforce reduction to the tune of 10k per year. With continued outsourcing and AI to fill the gaps. Which leads to experienced co-workers to deal with and bad moral for their seasoned professionals.
Bank-of-America,1fcdq5f7lt52g800,4,Comparatively - A Great Place to Work,Home Services Specialist II,"The lending industry can be ruthless. Bank of America is a great place to start as the training is excellent & will provide the skills & foundation that will benefit you with any employer. As a former 10 year employee in default and processing, I can say that it was time well spent. Though the overall compensation is lower, you do make it up in benefits. Insurance premiums are lower, PTO is plentiful, & work/life balance is 2nd to none. You can even outlive a poor manager if you stay focused on the work & detach from human personality & character faults in others. Overall, the company continually displays that they want to do the right thing for employees and customers. If you are lucky enough to get your foot in the door, the bank offers many different career paths, and opportunities to grow to those who are dedicated & willing to work hard & prove themselves. "
Bank-of-America,1fcdnfevru54i802,5,Great pay and unmatched benefits ,Relationship Manager,"Overall a company you wanna work for long term, needs a better work life balances. Goals and metrics are a bit much, but you can feel the difference it makes in clients lives. "

However you will be extremely stressed as every role in the financial center (even the tellers) is sales driven. If you are motivated though you can have a great career as BOA has great benefits and continuing education/ clubs for their employees 
Bank-of-America,1fc9kk8bnqelk802,3,Amazing but also the mean ones that slip through,Client Service Analyst I,"I loved BofA, I loved all entities which i have had a position under almost all in the personal/private/business aspect of the company.

Bank-of-America,1fc9ivbpjpib1802,2,Sressfull demanding job with no clear direction or guidance from upper management,Assistant Vice President / Branch Manager,"I have been with the company for nearly 10 years. I started out loving my job, the clients and the people I got to work with every day. That has gradually changed every year. Not enough resources (staffing/reliable technology) to do my job effectively. Management is more interested in calls and goals then providing its front line workers the tools needed to do their job. If not for the pandemic I would have left a few years ago. As a manager I am provided a livable wage but the stress and work level are quickly outweighing the benefits. They do provide great medical benefits, vacation benefits would be much better if you didn't have to change them multiple times a year to adjust to the companies needs and lack of preparation. "
Bank-of-America,1fc9a9u6bn51g800,3,Blah ,Account Manager,"It was just okay for me. Regular call center stuff. Calls, Calls, Calls. A revolving door for people. Most people don't last long because of the nagging phone calls. "
Bank-of-America,1fc95n5tjn51g802,3,benefits and time off are the only reason people stay,Foreclosure Specialist,the only reason people work here are for the benefits and time off. also the 401k program is pretty good. Its very hard to move up at this company or be hired for any job unless you know the hiring manager. you are expected to do more than what your job entails. I.E when someone in your group is hired you are going to take on their work with no additional pay. its just expected of you . management is no help when it comes to completing the work. it takes multiple emails to get items resolved.  constant org changes and manager changes to teams. there is absolutely no flexibility when you need to work from home. that is not allowed even if your job can 100 percent be completed at home . such as we are now because of the pandemic. they do expect for us to be back in office by sept so they can micro manage us and watch us work at our desks. the raises are awful. and its always the same thing coming from managers. you are a meets/meets no matter the amount of work you have done and you only get a 3 percent increase if that. would never recommend this place to someone needing an actual livable salary . this is okay for people starting out or needing a job but not for anyone who can do better or has a certification. 
Bank-of-America,1fc8s8hc4u4f3801,4,The benefits  was good medical  pension ,Operation Representative,"I had great  medical  coverage , 401k investment  pension ,paid holiday and the hourly pay was ok,the annual  review could have been better, and transferring  to other areas was an easy task."

Bank-of-America,1fc7506ggn51g802,3,Good things never last,Senior Financial Center Client Representative (FCCR),"At first I absolutely loved being a teller. Full staffed always. We were an extremely busy branch yet we never felt the stress. Until they started closing teller windows and going from 6-7 open windows to just 1-3. That really hurt. The lines never got shorter and the stress levels blew up. Felt overwhelming every single day. Plus, sales goals went up and became very stressful. "
Bank-of-America,1fc72tdjpu4f3802,4,Not a bad place,SVP,Good pay but cut throat culture. You have to be prepared for Reduction in Force often in a year. Working with different managers doesn't get anywhere because nothing gets done. 
Bank-of-America,1fc68bogv3kkq000,3,Counterproductive systems,Client Relationship Manager,Mades changes to job responsibilities without increasing the pay mid year.Feels like they are trying to go digital to replace employees and pay them less.Bonuses for loan processors are small compared to other banks.High turn over of employees in sales positions because the pay is less than other lenders.
Bank-of-America,1fc5b7hgtqelk800,3,Solid Job Security,Software Engineer II,It's a big bank so you don't need to worry about your job. Solid benefits. Hard to get promoted or get raises to keep up with inflation. Technology is behind other banks.
Bank-of-America,1fc4tifhbt57n802,3,It’s ok I guess,Sr. Retail Loan Processor,It\xe2\x80\x99s ok but it sucks they won\xe2\x80\x99t even consider remote work. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a good work life balance at all. You have to tolerate it for the benefits and pay.
Bank-of-America,1fc1vab85qelk800,3,The company has changed a lot,Client Care Representative II,This position is a great opportunity to get your foot into the door. If you're not satisfied with this position you can get promoted easily or move to other departments. 
Bank-of-America,1fc1nk0ul3kkq000,3,Benefits,Relationship Banker,Benefits are good . And the pay is fair as well. But is a lot micromanagement and also the sttrugle that you have to go through to get a promotion. Most of the times you are not seen for everything you do on benefit of the company. Is never enough. Is always needed more and morr
Bank-of-America,1fc1eq3au3kkq000,5,Great place to work ,Relationship Manager,Great place to work so far like it a lot. Everyone is really helpful and the training is extremely thorough. I would rec. this company to anyone. Benefits are fantastic and the pay is decent. 
Bank-of-America,1fbvd8mspqelk802,4,Fair Pay,Customer Service Representative,"I enjoyed my job most of the time. The times I did not enjoy it had more to do with the customers who were oftentimes quite rude. This had more to do with their unwillingness to take care of their financial business. Don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong though, the job was not easy. The benefits were very good.  A typical day requires you to speak with 30 to 40 customers a day. I would recommend trying it out. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great stepping stone, but you can also go into management if that\xe2\x80\x99s your style. "
Bank-of-America,1fbv6c8enpib1802,4,Teller ,Teller,Bank of America is a good place to work. The benefits are nice and the staff are friendly. Training is pretty easy and easy to grasp. Management at my branch was very supportive. 
Bank-of-America,1fbup06b9t57n800,4,great entry level job for banking/financial services ,Relationship Banker,"BOA is a great company with great ideas, unfortunately, those great ideas aren't great in execution.  With many new products and services, it's hard to figure out what's most important.  The relationship banking role is a great entry-level position but past that there really isn't much room to grow as of now.  Its customer service position with sales goals.  Starting pay is good for those new to banking or just out of college but not competitive for those with sales/banking experience. "
Bank-of-America,1fbuim0cgn51g800,5,able to move up quick,Bank Teller,good company to work for management are really good always helping in any way that they can help coworkers are awesome fun place to work sometime stresfull but nothing we cant handle
Bank-of-America,1fbuflu4kpib1802,3,Definitely a corporate setting,Relationship Banker,"If you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to back decisions made by people you\xe2\x80\x99ll never meet and who don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the work you do in the financial center, this is the job for you. Very large institution that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about their clients more than getting as much money from them as they can. Pay is decent and benefits are amazing. Just have to decide why you\xe2\x80\x99re working and if you can handle the corporate-ness of the job. "
Bank-of-America,1fbsldotst57n800,3,Really good co-worker talent,Senior Banker / Officer / Business and Loan Specialist,"Lobby full most of day.

Bank-of-America,1fbpq2gf4n51g800,4,Great environment ,Sales Specialist,"My experience was great,They give extensive training, and also coaching.. The managers are great,and very knowledgeable. Sometimes it can very stressful to always be on the phone,and some customers are very mean."

Bank-of-America,1fbpcns6pt57n802,3,Getting much worse,Director,Talk like they care about safety yet force us back in during Covid 19 breakout.  I am tired of you are doing great wfh but as soon as outbreak starts up again we need you there no matter what.  No matter if you and your family are at high risk for covid with pre-existing conditions.  Do not come and work here...
Bank-of-America,1fborhu0l3kkq002,4,People are always going to be people,Multiple Positions,"Bank of America as a company is just fine to work for.  In all my years (almost 20) I did see a lot of laziness and lack of clear management to encourage/correct those who were in this category.  As with any corporate structure, it's far from easy to navigate the HR policies and truly apply pressure to associates to perform.  This is two fold, lack of ability to implement discipline and on the flip side, lack of appropriate funding to reward associates for their stellar performance.Overall just like any other large company, it's an almost insurmountable challenge to maintain a standard expectation across a sea of potential regulatory and legal implications.Not a bad company, they try very hard to please and protect their customers.  Any negative experiences I had were due to poor management/vague expectations to avoid legal issues for the company."
Bank-of-America,1fbo0koj7u4f3802,3,Milleniall World,Client Service Representative,Work/Balance does nor work for a mature seasoned individual.  Too many clicks and selfies allowed.  Unprofessional environment. No real experience required .
Bank-of-America,1fbnro8mlt57n800,3,Good start,Corps Member,Thankful for the opportunity to work at Bank of America. Great learning opportunity whileI was there.  Benefits are great. Lots of restructuring whileI was there.
Bank-of-America,1fbndg5nhosjh800,2,Work overload,Foreclosure Specialist,"The company has layoffs on a quarterly basis. The department I worked in downsized from 40 associates to 8 associates. Needless to say, the workload was ridiculous and the standards for completing each file only tightened. The expectations were unrealistic and more than half of the employees that ""survived the cuts"" ended up leaving because of high level of stress. Oh, and don\'t be a second late from lunch because you will be pulled into the office!"
Bank-of-America,1fbnbeo6ssa3e800,4,Subpar Summer internship,Summer Analyst,"I worked as an intern summer of 2021 and I did not love the virtual format. I felt extremely isolated and unproductive because my team did not have much work for me. My manager was great, everyone I spoke to was helpful, and overall management seems good - but it was just not the same as normal. I think being in the office and being able to really talk with people and pick up small tasks would be far superior to my expereince"

Bank-of-America,1fbn3dtp0nq3h802,1,Ruthless management,Relationship Manager Business Owner Specialist,"A pressured sales environment where financial center manager and market leader will do whatever it takes to get the sales from client. Can never get a day off because management doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow it. One of the most toxic places i have worked by far. If you want to be a robot and just take orders and get screamed that its a job, but if you have expectation of more run away. "
Bank-of-America,1fbn01iq9sa3e800,5,Productive and fun place to work ,Consumer credit specialist,This is really a great place to work the managers are awesome there is exemplary growth and learning opportunities available.

Bank-of-America,1fblhb0b2u471800,3,Chaotic place to work,Assistant Manager,"Management is often ill-prepared to lead, there are no opportunities for real advancement. The pay is noncompetitive. There is no flexibility for work-life balance."
Bank-of-America,1fblf7vmfu3tu800,4,Eh its been 3 years ,QA Analyst,Boa has been good to me for the last 3 years. I dont liks to be babysat and thats what is starting to happen as a whole on the team no thanks. I will be moving on

Bank-of-America,1fbktmfbj3guo000,3,"Direct supervisors are great, but upper management is horrible",Relationship Banker,"The bonus structure that the company promises you in your contract is a complete farce. Despite there being a pandemic, upper management expects that you and your branch exceed the previous year\xe2\x80\x99s performance numbers. However, there is no compensation for performance. A person who opens one account per month will make the exact same as someone who opens 30. They continuously state that goals will be returning, so they are prepping us so that we aren\xe2\x80\x99t taken off guard when they do return. That\xe2\x80\x99s their roundabout way of having people work hard and not paying them for their work. They also have you come in very early for your shift, but the bank does not allow overtime, so in order to get your timesheet to say 40 hours by the end of the week, a lot of the work you do is off the clock. Lastly, upper management is catty and unprofessional. They will do everything in their power to prevent you from getting promoted if you are trying to leave from directly under their supervision. Many Relationship managers were trying to leave, so the market leader \xe2\x80\x9cpromoted\xe2\x80\x9d them. This promotion came with no extra pay or responsibilities, just a change of title. This was done to say that since they are now in a \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d role, they have to wait an additional 12 months before they can seek another role."
Bank-of-America,1fbkqqqi9u3tu800,5,Very good company to work for,Relationship Manager,The benefits that you get for working here are amazing. Health insurance and 401k is good. Match your contribution. Managers are really engaged and you work really closely with the people in your branches.

Bank-of-America,1fbinh362t4ui801,5,Good people,Sales Associate,Working for bank of america in the advanced client solution depart was a struggle at first. Learning the credit card products and procedures while following strict federal regulations is mentally demanding. The effort is worth the money and benefits.
Bank-of-America,1fbgti34jt4ui800,5,fun workplace.  ,Senior Teller,Bank of America was a great company to work for.  Very well compensated.  Great benefits.

Bank-of-America,1fbft9nfvu3rg800,5,Great management staff and environment,Call Center Supervisor,I worked in the call center in Pleasant Hill CA . Management staff was very helpful and job paid well for position. A lot of promotions from within. Pleasant experience.
Bank-of-America,1fbcq2n60t4hl800,1,Horrible would never recommend,Client Service Representative,"The pay is not bad, pretty decent actually. Very stressful work environment though, I will admit. They give you two 15 min breaks and an hour lunch break. God forbid you have to use the restroom, or step away for a moment, they will make you use your sick time and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have any left, it is considered an occurrence. No matter how short your bathroom break may be, it is an occurrence. The micromanaging aspect of this job, I could do without. The managers talk to you as if you\xe2\x80\x99re incompetent of simply answering the phones, because they are in a management position. I was there for over a year, thankfully I found a better position with great pay and managers who trust their employees to not baby them. Do not work here, target or Walmart would treat you way better."
Bank-of-America,1fbcq186rn5bb802,5,Best Company to Work ,Officer; Court Appearance Operations Analyst,"I survived the 2008 Countrywide Home Loans merger with Bank of America. Bank of America honored my time with Countrywide. As a result, I was able to take early retirement from the bank in 2019My final role with the Bank was 100% travel. I held this role for almost 10 years. The role was awesome until it wasn't. "

Fast paced and stressful at times but the team i was on was incredible. Great money and decent bonuses. Even my boss was cool. She didn't have a mortgage background d but she jumped in sand tried to learn as much as she could. Most managers there didn't want to learn. Like they were purposely not learning because the site transitioned from collections to mortgage and what they'd been doing for the last 10 plus years was gone. I get it
Bank-of-America,1fba9ujalt4hl801,4,No Job Security ,Customer Service Representative,Branch closed and area manager would not work with me on relocation. Co-workers we\xe2\x80\x99re great and helped each other meet sales goals. Raises were decent and hours were okay.
Bank-of-America,1fb9qb1mio1if802,4,"Great, depending on location & team",Medical Accommodations Consultant,"The company is good. But they don't quite understand how to keep their good employees. Through pay or advancement. I stayed far to many years thinking I could advance. But I kept getting the same story over and over. You have to be in Charlotte, NC to advance to any Sr. Roles. Also, pray you get a good manager. I had a terrible manager, and left because I could not work under this person. There were some questionable ethical decisions made on the leadership side. Knowing how leadership just hung you out to dry, I wanted no part in this. It was time for me  to go. "
Bank-of-America,1fb9mghuns7nl800,1,Highly focused workplace,Customer Service Representative,"The benefits at the bank of America are great, really outdid themselves there. However, the growth outlook and opportunity for existing employees are not always the best. I also don't recommend this company as they are not the most flexible with their work hours."
Bank-of-America,1fb7k6dehu39i802,5,Great company to work,Operational Excellence Specialist,A great company to work with great benefits and employee development opportunities. Overall culture is inclusive and you are encouraged to being yourself at work. 
Bank-of-America,1fb774ckjs79a800,5,Fun workplace ,Fraud Analyst II,"I enjoyed my time here, the only reason I left was because daycare was too expensive so after I had my first born I decided to be a stay at home parent. Now I am looking to get back to work. I was a video teller and worked in the fraud dept. managers were nice and the job training was great. Recommend."
Bank-of-America,1fb7123ia3od8001,5,"Good Company, but can be challenging work/life balance",Senior Systems Engineer,"As a previous MBNA employee when Bank of America purchased MBNA, I was one of about 70% of the workforce that was able to stay on.  MBNA was an extremely fast-paced and result oriented workplace,  a culture which was very stressful.  Some of this was retained during the transition, and for the most part made much better.The biggest challenge week to week is keeping your work and life balance.  You can work crazy hours, lots of them, especially during production issues and new releases.  Though, most managers (including my own), made sure we got some time off comped and I never had a problem getting a hour or two during regular days to take care of personal needs.All in all, I would say that BoA is a great place to work and I would return  to the company, given the right position. "
Bank-of-America,1fb6h95luo213801,4,Great people to work with ,Home Loan Processor,Under staffed over worked and stressful. The company overall is great. Management is there to help you and you are not micro managed. You have a huge pipeline and are expected to mange and meet deadline. 
Bank-of-America,1fb5t92kfs79a802,3,Working 6 days a week - every week ! ,Manager,Pay can\xe2\x80\x99t be beat- or even matched by other firms- but you will pay for it with your personal life . Work is 6 days a week sometimes 10 hours a day . This is expected to be accepted as a salaried employee - so you won\xe2\x80\x99t make any overtime doing it either. Constant changes and rotations of managers and of employees . 
Bank-of-America,1fb5bhar4t4r7802,4,Not bad for a start,Bank Teller,"Decent job if you're starting off as a bank teller. There is room for advancement if you work hard and follow direction. Be friendly, do your job, go home. "
Bank-of-America,1fb51ddtdhije802,4,"Great Benefits, Difficult Job",Client Service Representative,"Customer service work is very hard.  BOA compensates well based on the market and the benefits are unbeatable.  In my experience there is an openness toward people needing to have mental, emotional resources and work life balance.  Managers are nice enough.  Advancement from within is regularly seen and encouraged.  It\'s a very difficult job mentally though.  If you\'re gonna do it, make sure you\'re getting as much as you can get and not many companies could come close to BOA in terms of the compensation, opportunity, and benefits.    I don\'t however like that if you work a certain shift it\'s hard to get out of it unless you ""bid"" for it based on tenure and metrics.  2nd shift is very draining if you are a morning person.  They are ALWAYS hiring so I wish they would be more flexible with scheduling.  There are plenty of people willing to work night and weekend shifts.  Love working from home though and hope I never have to be in office.    Great equipment provided as well."
Bank-of-America,1fb2ucb7bs7f7800,4,Great,Preferred Sales Agent,Awesome place to be many opportunities to advance in your career. The pay plus benefits are at the top of the industry. My immediate mangers were always helpful 
Bank-of-America,1fb13un44npf6801,4,Performance managed environment. ,Team Manager,Overall I have gained a lot of experience working for Bank of  America. Good company culture and good benefits. Majority of the co-worker are welcoming and nice. 
Bank-of-America,1fb0tfo3rnpf6800,3,It’s a good place to start off.,Banker,"The training is very through. You get 2 weeks for teller and 5 weeks for banker. The workplace culture is very open and accepting. With that being said, the company itself is constantly changing rules and procedures weekly. Some things they have you do are extremely unreasonable such as making outreach phone calls while having to use a very robotic sounding script. The customers hate this, and are almost always annoyed you called them. The technology they have is also way behind other banks. Constant system crashes, things just not working at all and unreliable marketing tools makes the job even harder. Plus they\xe2\x80\x99re pushing everything digital now, trying to get clients to do everything theirselves, such as deposit checks with the mobile app or use the ATM instead of the teller for withdrawals and deposits. "
Bank-of-America,1fb0t8h58npeg802,3,There’s good and bad ,Investment Specialist,"They really take time when it comes to training, Although, since they work on about 8 different systems, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be enough. Once out of training, there was a SEVERE lack of support. We are to depend on the knowledge of other colleagues who may or may not respond to help you. If they do help you, instead of giving you a response, they may send you a manual to read through while you have the client on hold. They do have a help line that you can call, although they leave at a specific time, so if you\xe2\x80\x99re working after that time, you just have to fend for yourself. Although they have great benefits and pay, this is a stressful job. Most days, calls are back to back. I personally can take anywhere from 30-60 calls a day. They have high metrics, and although it\xe2\x80\x99s a client support department, you are still required to upsell and have a daily target to hit. Since it\xe2\x80\x99s a call center, it\xe2\x80\x99s very micromanaged. If they had more employee support for when questions arise during calls, that would have helped tremendously, but they just throw us to the wolves once out of training. Also, they informed me they\xe2\x80\x99d work with my school schedule, but they haven\xe2\x80\x99t as of yet. "
Bank-of-America,1fb0rbap3s7f7800,3,Lots of hours ,Loan Processor,Worked lots of hours a week on average 50 plus. Pay was good but I was overworked and stressed most of the time. Very competitive environment and always felt like my job was in jeopardy. Huge turnover in employees too. 
Bank-of-America,1fb01lf26o25r800,5,Good job ,Collections Specialist,"Good job, good hours, great company, good management, supporting staff at all times, handled the pandemic shift well. Very friendly people that all work there "
Bank-of-America,1favta206t4lp800,4,Good benefits ,Customer Service Representative,Decent company to work for. They were very generous to people with kids throughout the pandemic(100$ per day for day care).Also gave 2 weeks paid time off every time you had ANY type of symptoms(which obviously got abused by some employees) so worked short staffed pretty much through most of the pandemic. 
Bank-of-America,1favr0in2o25r802,1,Not what it’s cracked up to be,Relationship Banker,Was hired as an RB and was told it\xe2\x80\x99d be 70/30 split between platform and teller line. More like 10/90. Be ready for unreasonable goals and outreach calling that does relationship bankers no good because of teller line time. Benefits are awesome but chances to move up are not great. 
Bank-of-America,1favkgo8hsa6u802,3,Management ,Relationship Manager II,All they care about is number and can be easily get write up if you miss a month when the numbers are based off the quarter . There could be advancement  but manager has to say too can go. 
Bank-of-America,1fav71m57u1ea800,3,You’ll make good money ,Relationship Manager lending specialist ,BOA pay their employees well but at the same time they are eliminating positions which leave many employees with more task. The micromanaging is too much at time. 
Bank-of-America,1faue751bsa6u800,4,Excellent company,Programmer Analyst,Work hard and you will succeed. Management is variable depending on to whom you are assigned Good work life balance and working hours. Not a lot of overtime.
Bank-of-America,1fat4ctnau1ea802,3,A numbers game.,Customer Service Representative,"The priorities of lower level management do not align with the company\xe2\x80\x99s overall mission. The corporate training will advise one course of action meanwhile supervisors insist on bare minimum customer assistance to expedite each call. Every task throughout your shift is timed and turned into a stat for a pie chart to rank individual performance. Your entire day is monitored and micromanaged to the fullest extent. Customer survey scores must be high and average call handle time, fee refunds, and customer transfers must remain low. The bonus potential for satisfactory performance quotas was removed as of  2020. Departments do not communicate effectively to serve the consumer leaving many agents to attempt to assist customers with issues that they are unfamiliar with."
Bank-of-America,1faslp664o2ea802,4,Fun ans productivity ,Teller,Well I jusr would like to say working fir this company has its benefits such as vacation. However management needs to revamp their mrthods of managmrnt 
Bank-of-America,1fas0lfgio2ea800,3,Difficult to get mingled with team,Relationship Banker,"Having everyone as seniors they find hardtime to accept new joinees, always questioning sometimes irrelavant that always having a mindset that they will not do mistakes  but the new joinees will. Gossiping and making situations unfair for new joinees. Be a teller even when you are recruited as relationship banker because sales are meant for relationship managers. I expected growth in my career so joined as relationship banker but just making teller transactions no use at all. Horrible experience"
Bank-of-America,1farjvt0rt4lp800,4,Great place for benefits.,Sales Associate,"Bank of America is a great place for benefits when it comes to insurance, holidays, and 401k. There is a lot changes going on and the understaffing can be very stressful for employee and clients."

Digital transformation will be a long climb for this company."
Bank-of-America,1fanndt2usa6u800,4,Good company. Average environment ,Asst. Vice President/Financial Solutions Advisor,High pressure and focus on products rather than process.

Bank-of-America,1faj9ga3233ip002,2,Great benefits bad management,Relationship Banker,"A good place to work if you like making a lot of outbound/cold calls and insane sales goals. pay is inconsistent. Your experience will depend heavily on your manager (ie, crummy manager = crummy experience). Not a lot of mobility. Generous vacation/sick time policies. BOFA is huge on being a collaborative and inclusive work environment, but some coworkers and managers do the complete opposite and make the environment hostile. Management has favorites and if your not their favorite be prepared to work every weekend and teller. It's nearly impossible to complete all banker work because you're also expected to be a teller, originate loans, answer calls, complete training, etc. Expect lots of pointless meetings and being constantly short-staffed."
Bank-of-America,1faj11ggqt4lp801,3,Good Benefits,Commercial Support Specialist,"Great benefits, but it is hard to advance. They often hire from outside of the company instead of within. Pay is decent but does not increase much unless you get a new role."
Bank-of-America,1fa0q35dvs7ln801,1,Extremely toxic,Branch Manager,Micro managed on the granular level. Humiliated and made an example of in front of your peers for not meeting sales goals. Very stressful workplace environment where the customer does not come first and neither do the associates.
Bank-of-America,1fa0aqvtas7io800,4,Enjoyed the people and the atmosphere,Customer Service Representative,"I believer their inability to place people where they would be more effective was an issue I brought up to them, and they tried to explain their views on placement and it didnt seem too effective to me."

Bank-of-America,1f9rhcdeis7io800,3,Meeting Metrics is the priority ,RESEARCH AND ADJUSTMENT REP III,"The experience of working at BOA I believe is no different than any other bank. I had excellent managers which made my job tolerable. In all fairness I did not come from a financial background and this made it difficult for me to respond to some inquiries. Training was provided and coworkers with banking experience were able to grasp the terminology and specific procedures quickly. Ultimately I did succeed in the job with a manager who provided the supportive input to get me through a slow arduous growth. Unfortunately everyone is not so lucky. Regarding the metrics, every moment of everyday you are confined to your seat according to statically software. If you are fast and know banking procedures you can manage a few free moments to socialize with a coworker. There are changes and new information to mentally process daily but no time is given for this or to manage your emails. Anything outside of incoming phone calls in have to figure out a method to get it done without overtime. Breaks and lunch are to the minute to meet metrics and many employees use some of their personal time to complete work tasks. If you are young and start out in a metric based, core financial environment, and have not experienced a less micromanaged culture you most likely will succeed. "
Bank-of-America,1f9or9rjsnpjo802,2,Stressful ,Client Service Representative II,This job is extremely stressful. You are not given tools or knowledge during training to succeed. Strict schedules and micro-managing. Everyday is something different and always a threat to be written up. No flexibility in schedule. Very high turn over rate. Don't let the pay fool you. They pay you well to treat you badly.
Bank-of-America,1f9l7tai5hipq800,3,This company tolerates lots of abuses my managers,Senior Systems Architect,"Not sure, it is very reactionary and not considerate of basic human values and rights. There are managers and leads who think that only them should succeed."

Bank-of-America,1f9i6779cs7io802,5,Best Benefits out there,Sr. Sales Representative,Bonuses can be quite sizable for sales. Up to 10k a quarter for phone sales. Benefits are awesome. Cheap premiums. Minimum wage is $20. 160 hours vacation from the start and 80 hours personal/sick time.
Bank-of-America,1f9hk8vachipq802,2,"Unproductive, worries more about stats and metrics",Account Supervisor,Management is more concerned with metrics than regulatory requirements and getting things right. They say they care about customers but continuously show that all they care about is metrics and how long calls take. For a fraud reporting this is a huge issue because the focus should be on getting the information right and filing claims to help customers.
Bank-of-America,1f9hfrc9as7ln800,5,Great Work/Life Balance,Program Consultant I,"Bank of America is truly one of the best companies to work for. If I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I was being called to do something else, I\xe2\x80\x99d remain a part of the team.

Bank-of-America,1f9flcbh2hipq800,3,Run ,Relationship Manager,Unrealistic expectations. I have been with the company over 5 years and there is ALWAYS a staffing problem. False promises. Very political. It\xe2\x80\x99s not about how good you are it\xe2\x80\x99s about who you know. They will pay new hires more than you. The pay is not competitive . The raises are a joke. No real bonus. The training is terrible. Their products and services aren\xe2\x80\x99t competitive. Major systems issues DAILY. Some of the policies make it very hard to do your job. They expect way too much out of you to not pay you for it. They do not take care of their employees long term. They burn you out. And they offered no hazard pay during the pandemic and not one person got a raise for 2020 or 2021
Bank-of-America,1f9ehm9m0s7ln802,3,Too much red tape,VP of Operations,Con: Lots of red tape.  Trying to get anything done takes forever (at least on the IT side) and that's assuming you can find the right person/team.  Pro: Compensation/benefits is fair.

Just no further opportunities."
Bank-of-America,1f99hip25ocrl802,3,It was okay..,Phone Banker,The job was ok. Training was great but once you get out on the floor to take calls it can be stressful. The customers were usually not too bad but there were at least 2-3 bad calls a day. I constantly had to call for a manager but still had to solicit for surveys while also keeping the calls short. What a headache.

Bank-of-America,1f97aegant4ig800,4,"Nice people, okay job",Relationship Manager,Job can be intense. For average pay there is an insane amount of pressure to sell. Higher ups will visit financial centers to critique them. Most people in the company are genuinely nice people and will help you when you need it. Bank of America offers good sick time and vacation time. Even if you do have to work on Saturday it will be a half-day and you're never expected to work more than 40 hours.

Bank-of-America,1f956tttsu2h4800,3,"Great co-workers, but stressful environment",IT Team Manager,"While I enjoyed working with others at my level and below, the work was extremely stressful.  Many of the policies and decisions that affected our work were made at a much higher level, then applied to everyone in a one-size-fits-all approach.  Timelines for system enhancement projects are based on time and cost with little regard for the amount of work involved, the quality of the result, or the impact on the workload and morale of the team doing the work.  Technical staff are assumed to be interchangeable based on technical skill set with no regard for knowledge of the business processes or complexities of the specific systems they support. "
Bank-of-America,1f94lt5too26d800,4,Efficient workplace ,"Assistant Vice President, Financial Center Manager",The organization is fantastic.  What makes it hard to work within the organization is the leadership in mid level leadership.  Instead of providing the vision of the organization the mid level leadership dictate the organization vision.  This makes it difficult to buy in. However the organization itself is great. It is a great place to work.  It just depends on the leader within the organization if your experience is good or bad. 
Bank-of-America,1f93f48vtt4ig800,3,No work life balance,Senior QA Lead,No work life balance.. apart from this no a bad company.. salary and benefits are great. its just alot of competition from vendor contractors who are working anywhere from 12 to 16 hr/day.. management expects the same from everyone and if you are doing the same then you are not giving you 100%

They push referrals extremely hard and if you aren't hitting them, it's hard to advance. They want you to offer every client you speak to products and get them over to the desk, but in reality most people get mad when you start trying to push banking products on them. Management is usually a hit or miss, they can be brutal or awesome, it totally depends. If you're someone who is good at sales and doesn't mind it, you'll do well.

Over the years, the work life balance became something of the past. We were short handed so much that when you needed to call in for being sick, needs of a child etc, you felt guilty. Requesting time off was difficult because you had to manage it between other centers who would be helping in your absence. The benefits were great and maternity leave is the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen with any company. If I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have young kids, I would probably apply to work there again. "

Bank-of-America,1f7lvg6hkn59q800,3,"Good people, but can be frustrating.",Vice President,"First, there is a lot of helpful people and a lot of support recently to grow your career through internal moves and promotions. They fully support moving between business and operational functions of your skill set translates. If you can prove your worth, you really get an opportunity to personally stand out and represent yourself.But there are drawbacks. Mainly the company pays slightly below peers, and the company also is stubborn about investing in people processes that will foster job quality improvement. It is very bureaucratic and siloed. You team may be spread out around the country and you may rarely personally meet your direct manager or direct reports; therefore, some roles lack culture."
Bank-of-America,1f7lo6g5sn59q800,3,Woke company,Vice President,"Company is bowing to small interests and not fulfilling it's goal of ALL INCLUSIVENESS.

Bank-of-America,1f7h44e8io1nd800,2,no outlets at work for hard calls,Sr. Consumer Banker,"Bank of America seems to care more about making numbers then their associates. When I started working at Bank of America, I love it! After 3 years of working for the company new call center leaders came in and ruined it all. They put so many restrictions and unattainable numbers on the associates it was no longer a fun place to work. My stress level went through the roof along with my co workers. Many of my co workers left feeling overwhelmed and unappreciated for the hard work we did day in and day out. I witnessed many associates in tears. What a disappointment!"

Sometimes it is a little frustrating with the customers you interact with, they can be a bit aggressive but there is always someone there to help you succeed."
Bank-of-America,1f7caupt3u2ud800,3,Good Pay and Benefits. Horrible Corporate Decisions.,Senior Client Service Representative,"I've been working here for the past few years. Pay is very good, as well as the benefits. Overall a very solid employer. However, the job can be extremely stressful mentally. You feel like the back office never really communicates down the chain about what they're plans are. The corporation itself makes it hard to defend its products to customer's when they have a complaint because, you yourself will end up agreeing with the customer, but the bank expects you to advocate for them. They monitor way too many stats for us reps to keep up on and hold you to a very hard to reach standard.  They rate you based on the Surveys that client's take about you and how long you spend with the customer's on each call, which is understandable to a point. However, if the customer rates you anything less than a 9 out of 10, the survey counts as a 0. This leads you to basically begging the client to give you a good rating, even if your hands were tied due to bank policy or lack of a logical system. The system as a whole needs to be revamped. Instead of working on improving the parts that need improvement, they keep adding new stuff, making it harder and harder for most of the departments to keep up.  There's a large feeling of miscommunication amongst each department that's within the bank which almost feels like no one knows how to truly do their job. Even when these issues are brought up in meetings, or to the higher ups, it feels like management just brushes it off as no big deal and keeps adding new features that cause new problems for the client's. "
Bank-of-America,1f7brt01jt3q7800,3,Can be stressful ,Processed Payments and Customer Service Representative,This job is ok if you like working from home. The customers can be really angry and upset at times but if you\xe2\x80\x99re great at de-escalation then this is great job for you.

All day BS conference calls. Horrible place "
Bank-of-America,1f76heef83obs000,2,Compensation ,Customer Service Representative,"Bank of America is a great place to work but there is no loyalty, no family atsmosphere, so if you're looking for a nice check and taking thousands of calls per week non stop back to back then go for it. Also your job depends upon your metrics , for example the survey if you dont meet 90 or above that's considered a fail and possibilities of discipline action, so if the client gives you low scores on the survey that can get you a written and put on a 4 week plan to improve or separate. So this is aGood place to work because of some of the people, are so nice and kind. "

Bank-of-America,1f6smnl77s7es800,4,Mostly a great place to work ,Client Service Representative,"They're actually a decent company considering that they're a giant corporate bank. They pay better than all other banks and the benefits are top notch. That being said, they expect a lot from you. The environment is fast paced & highly stressful. The majority of positions come with many high level goals you must reach. Some days are hard to handle with the never ending lines of people waiting, and of course most of them are unsympathetic to your struggles. They want what they want and if they don't get it, you will have to listen to them yelling and/or complaining. Some customers are even abusive because they don't understand policies & procedures. You need to be mentally tough to deal with bank customers. It can wear you down sometimes. Work life balance is not the best if you work at a location that's open Saturday because you'll sometimes have split days off. On the other hand, pto & paid holidays are great. All in all, a good job that pays well and it's worth staying if you can handle all of the stress."

Bank-of-America,1f6i9380lt4th800,4,Generally an easy gig with great pay and benefits,CSR 3,"Job consists of taking calls and adhering to a set schedule. Some days calls can be back to back creating a rather stressful work day. However if your patient, clients will reward you with praise. It's very rewarding. Working from home has been beneficial and expecting some sort of hybrid work model in the future. Management will generally work with you to help work life balance or with any personal or work issues that may arise. At time work can be dull. It does seem like there is a lack of advancement opportunities and favoritism does play into advancement decisions. Overall a good place to work that you can make a career out of if your good at it. However job security should always be at the front of your mind due to the nature of the work. "
Bank-of-America,1f6i0cmrus9tt800,4,Standar banking hours are great. ,Financial Center Assistant Manager,Banking hours are great. The bank seems to be moving in a direction where technology will be key. The bank treated its employees great during the COVID pandemic

Bank-of-America,1f6fhpqgmt4nb800,3,Management is everything ,Financial Center Customer Service Representative/Teller,While working 7 years for the company. Bank of America is shifting fast to take employees concerns into consideration. The company is starting to pay employees livable wages and still has good benefits. Management is everything. Working in customer service is very hard and getting yelled in person was a regular from customers for things your cannot control. Most policies upset customers and employees got the wrong end of the stick. Most managers didn\xe2\x80\x99t care about employees or their need but only the extremely high sales goals. Sales was the only thing management cared about along with customer reviews. They wanted you to work harder to they can make more money and get compensated.Working at any position is a high stress job that usually require sales goals. Most likely you will be required to meet a quota. 
Bank-of-America,1f6ei5amqo1gm800,5,Relationship manager ,RELATIONSHIP MANAGER,Things may look hard from time to time but there are so many people that you can reach out to help you.

Bank-of-America,1f67igo4d3ocs000,4,I loved working at BOA ,Bank Teller,Pay and benefits were good and the schedule was great. The only thing that I would change would be the fact that it is such a big company so you don't get the typical personal relationship you get with customers as ypu do working for a smaller bank.

In the company it's not about how much you know or how well you do your job, it's about who you know and what you can do for them to help you move up.

The base pay is minimal, bonuses are every quarter and can be taken away easily, and we have to meet ridiculous standards.

You have to be good at sales and be very punctual or else you'll be getting a lecture from the manager. If you think  you can handle that, I say go for it. "

Bank-of-America,1f5jbe0poo1kn800,2,"Well paid, but limited upwards mobility.",Customer Service Representative,"Working for B of A is great if you have no ambition and want a steady income. However, promotions are incredibly difficult to get since the bank prioritizes hiring externally. Even though the company says they love developing employees, my experience there proved otherwise. Management can be hit or miss, but overall the relationships you form with your coworkers will determine whether the job is worth it. "
Bank-of-America,1f5hgb6h4sa39800,3,Paycheck cleared,Suspense Coordinator,You\xe2\x80\x99re a number in the system but it\xe2\x80\x99s a big bank so it\xe2\x80\x99s to be expected. You can learn what you need and the training was stronger than other employers I\xe2\x80\x99ve had.

Also, if there\'s any gray area, rest assured that instead of exploring ways to make it work, the answer is always going to be ""no."""
Bank-of-America,1f5ekcck1u2n1800,2,Metrics ,Cost Basis Financial Analyst,"Being assigned a metric to calculate productivity is counter intuitive. I had to complete 5 assignments per day, regardless of the size of the valuation. If I completed  5 valuations with 10 securities each, thats 50 updates and that\xe2\x80\x99s 5 completed items. Some valuations could be up to 200 securities, and would still only count as one single completion. The weight assignments held made no sense, and returning requests because they were not eligible did not count towards my workload. All management cared about was completing assignments, despite being improperly trained for such tasks. Messaging managers and supervisors would not be considered productive. It is almost as if I was expected to complete an assignment despite not knowing what to do. Once a week my supervisor would Skype me and asking why my previous weeks numbers were so low. It is HIGHLY offensive not to mention totally unprofessional , to berate an employee for not meeting a superficial number, despite being made aware of everything that had to be completed. I worked as hard as I could, but it just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good enough for my supervisors. "

Management was great at providing a pathway in which to achieve your personal goals. Hours were fairly what you would expect. Time off was granted based off of seniority tho. So forget getting Christmas week and spring break off with your kids unless you have been there forever. Overall, I enjoyed my time with the bank."
Bank-of-America,1f58bs5rbu3af800,4,My thoughts ,Global operations,Workflow is busy on some days and good vibes in the floor. Going from contract to permanent is like trying to find a million dollars in a haystack it isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to go well and you will end up doing it over and over over and eventually u get told No. 
Bank-of-America,1f57lbncu308d000,3,Great Place to Learn,Bank Teller/Sales & Service Specialist/Personal Banker,Bank of America taught me many things. One major skill asset I learned was elite customer service. You are taught and trained throughout your entire employment career the essentials of delivering customer service.  
Bank-of-America,1f56rtgdc308d000,2,Don’t recommend ,Relationship Banker,"The company only cares about sales, they want only one teller and everyone to be bankers and on the floor. The line could be out the door and they will let the 1-2 tellers struggle because they want the bankers to pull people out the line to \xe2\x80\x9cbuild a relationship\xe2\x80\x9d (sale loans, credit cards, etc.) to the clients. Most people come in just to go to the tellers not to get sold something. "

Bank-of-America,1f55pbvlesaai800,4,Great BOA branch.,Teller,"Manager was exceptional to both staff and customers. Customers were mostly friendly as well as the longterm coworkers. It was a smoothly run, professional yet warm environment.

Bank-of-America,1f525hlrmo1kn800,1,Was better,SVP,Last 3 years there is a lack of development of people for succession planning.  People leave for huge increases in pay 30% to do less work.  Positions are not backfilled in any sort of timely manner - even then it is limited.  There is no work life balance at all. 
Bank-of-America,1f51sc2pfsa39800,3,Felt like I was pressured ,Sales Representative,I do not feel like I was helping people I feel like I was putting people into more debt because they were constantly pushing to get clients to open up new credit cards even though they\xe2\x80\x99ve already had three with us and you can see what their outside debt is and sometimes it would be a lot of money and they would still want you to push for more from them.
Bank-of-America,1f51k232lu2n1800,3,Who you know,Customer Service Representative,"They say you can move up easy but its more who you know not what you know. The managers are lazy, site leaders thought are on it and very good but then underlings are not on the same page. There are a few managers that do a great job but I'd say only 25%. It is great pay and benefits if you can last. They go through people like crazy"

Bad culture to work in, many bank system and associate errors due to high pressure enviornment. Performance goals so high only 1 of 2 people in the entire company can reach. If you do not hit goals, no advancement opportunity. Takes about 7 years to be promoted to senior/ manager from what i observed, which is very slow compared to most companies.

Managers were nice and helpful, I had four managers in the year I worked for them (lots of opportunity to move up and go far) . Cons- The calls were back to back which can be stressful when working a 10 hour shift, and you are closely monitored by managers with call listening. Hard to change work schedule had to wait until end of year to get slightly better schedule. Overall great company would love to work for them again but not on the phones. "

Bank-of-America,1f4nr3linsa8r800,3,Good and bad like any other company ,Home loans closer,"I really enjoy my job and the team I am on. I like the job itself even though it can be very demanding. The people I work with are good people and the benefits are good. The pay however is an issue for me. Anybody that works in the mortgage industry shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be making less than 50k a year and unfortunately most of us do. On top of the pay our bonuses have been taken away. For the work that is expected of us and in comparison of what other banks are paying the pay is a big issue. Also, most banks have announced work from home permanently and unfortunately Bank of America just won\xe2\x80\x99t do that. They will not give a return date or announce when we will work from home permanently, which is pretty sad being we have all the tools we need to stay working from home. These two things are major things that have me considering moving on from this company. "
Bank-of-America,1f4n7iaeo2v6h000,4,"Good Company, Great Benefits, Bad Management",Pinnacle Mortgage Loan Coordinator,"I can't speak for other lines of business at the bank as they all are so very different with their own culture. The mortgage department, like anywhere else, is fast-paced and deadline driven. The benefits at the bank are excellent and unmatched by any other company I've worked for. PTO that increases with tenure, 401k matching, low health insurance premiums (I'm currently paying double the premium at my current company for a worse plan). Things I did not like at the company included the ever increasing expectations of management, not necessarily by my direct mangers, but the higher-ups in the company. The micromanaging is insane to the point where it creates roadblocks in the mortgage process rather than increasing efficiency. I did enjoy working with my coworkers there and my direct manager was excellent. My reason for leaving was a huge change in how we are compensated. It basically cut my compensation in half. I wouldn't have left otherwise. If they changed it back and had openings, I would go back in a heartbeat. "

Bank-of-America,1f4fjpp2r2v6h000,4,Customer Service Excellence,Customer Service Representative III,"Being as fair as possible, this is a solid company to work for (when I was there). The company culture is great, the pay is great, the (team managers) management is great, the benefits are amazing, and the environment is clean and professional. I enjoyed the freedom of two computer screens, access to Microsoft products while working (OneNote, Excel, Word, Powerpoint, etc) and that access only made the job more bearable. The training was very good and completely prepared us for what to expect on the floor. My managers and coworkers were friendly, involved with company events, and NOT passive-aggressive. It still is a call center environment, thought the wealth management clients are intelligent so it doesn\'t feel as bad taking calls.Some of the things I didn\'t like was upper managements decision-making. Aside from the regular metrics, there was a metric for ""digital promotion"" which required agents to promote online products. When this was implemented the job began to feel like sales as the metric could only be satisfied whenever clients would accept- which was rare/ and usually caused the clients to get extremely upset. The coaching has always been clear and delivered with care. Aside from regular call center nonsense (people inappropriately transferring you calls from time to time), you do want to watch out for the Financial Advisors as they can be very rude and degrading with no consequences. Generally, most of them are good people and just want to get stuff done quickly. Only other negative things is some days the call volume can get insane. BOA needs to open another building"

Extremely archaic in most regards- from the facilities that look like you stepped into a portal to the 80\xe2\x80\x99s, to the poor leadership and just incompetent individual contributors. Most ppl I interacted with acted like self important boobs. I hated the uptight and self congratulatory attitude of this place and I returned to my previous company about a year in. I never recommend BoA."

Bank-of-America,1f49cjcudsa8r800,3,Overall it’s a good company,Fraud Analyst,Overall the company is not bad to work for. You must network to advance and take advantage of who you know.

Bank-of-America,1f48n8d1hu39f800,3,Some good.. some bad,Branch Manager,The company had great benefits and seemed like a great place to work. I was placed in very busy location during training which didn't afford me adequate environment for my on floor training so was confined to training computer all day.  I was placed after my alloted training time as Branch Manager into my location still feeling very under trained.

Pay is 30% lower than competition.Plenty of work to do and all of the time. It is tough to catch your breath some days. Senior management is disconnected regarding compensation. The Bank is experiencing a lot of turnover now because people are realizing they can earn over 30% more of their current salary outside of the Bank. Would be easier if the Bank would pay current rates instead of waiting to let good staff walk away. 
Bank-of-America,1f418bi72npee800,1,they over work you,Relationship Manager,"do not fall for this company. I was very excited to be a part of bofa. Training was great, but management and FCMs are not so great. The top management needs to be smarter  on choosing the managers and market leaders. they tend to overwork you. hours are long and they have cut a lot of the benefits since the pandemic started. They are very sales focused and never appreciate the little things. They will move you around based on the company's needs and dont care how far you have to commute. So funny how a teller and a banker get paid at the same hourly rate...."

There is always a way and a response to someone who says ""no"". But unfortunately depending on location, the number of people willing and having the resources to say yes varies as well as the opportunity amount. Are you looking out for yourself or for what\'s best financially for the client? You can answer that yourself. If you are a go getter, this job is for you. If you dont like sales change career paths, not everyone is meant for it and thats ok. You will be held responsible for your performance."

Bank-of-America,1f3rhrsvns7ju800,4,Fast-paced and performance focused ,Relationship Banker/Fraud Agent,"Great company to work for if you are productive and driven. They prefer to promote/hire from within, so there is potential for upward or even horizontal movement. If an RB/RM/or even CSR you will have goals you need to meet (outbound calls/certain banking products sales/etc).

Rep II,"BOA seems like a great company at first glance, and they make you think it\xe2\x80\x99s an amazing and supportive environment by only introducing you to people who have been with the company for a long time. I\xe2\x80\x99m convinced those people do not know what other jobs feel like. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very \xe2\x80\x9cbig brother is always watching\xe2\x80\x9d environment, I had to record every time I even went to the bathroom. My manager was amazing as was the supervisor for my team, but the others were awful. They get annoyed when you ask for help and basically tell you to figure it out yourself. They are not customer focused.  I rose to the top of my 15 person team within my first month there, because the employees just don\xe2\x80\x99t care. Worst of all, you have to stay in your position for a year before you can move up. I feel I was underpaid and over qualified and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t work that job for another day. I worked from home as a preferred deposits call center agent. "
Bank-of-America,1f3e245i4u3bc800,3,Good benefits and respectful environment,Vice President,BOA has great benefits and cares about their employees.

Bank-of-America,1f38tn03tu3dj800,2,"cannot speak for entire company but avoid RFS in Newark, DE",SR Client Advocate," Avoid the department in general and the position specifically LIKE THE PLAGUE. Ruined myself and several co-workers' mental health, they blackball you so you can't get out of the department. I've been told the entire company is not like this but I couldn't continue to sacrifice my mental health to try to find out/get out. I  also did and do not bank with them before because the business is so poorly run, I  saw this even moreso when I  worked with them. Made dumb decisions that screwed our customers over even after employees made suggestions."

Bank-of-America,1f2qg3osj2v5r000,1,Nice coworkers ,Contract Attorney,Had nice colleagues; extremely underpaid; no benefits; continuous training that was irrelevant and confusing.  Many workers got sick from stress.     
Bank-of-America,1f2q3s78chim2800,4,Good company to work for,VP,Company gives ample opportunity to learn and gain experience with good work life balance. Teams I have worked with have all been great where every member is genuinely interested in helping each other. One area where I think there is need for improvement is career growth.
Bank-of-America,1f2pb8d9r3ki8000,2,2.0 overall,Teller,I started working at BOA in September of 2019 and I started as part time teller. Since January of last year I have been working as full time. Monday through Friday and I have had countless conversations with the manager about this and no change has been made. I am still considered part time and on work day when I go on vacation am only paid for 4 hours instead of 8 because of this. When I reached out to HR they were completely useless and said \xe2\x80\x9cI could work up to 6 days a week and still be considered part time\xe2\x80\x9d. And they once told me that they had \xe2\x80\x9cmax\xe2\x80\x9d full time tellers. Yet all tellers became bankers and now I am the only teller left. 
Bank-of-America,1f2p9v766309g000,3,Nice team ,Teller,"Not the best company to work for, clients were regulars and nice but not much advancement it seemed. Tellers were there for 30 plus years doing the same job "
Bank-of-America,1f2o5mubehim2800,3,Sales and more sales ,Teller,When I worked here everything was about sales and customer service was lacking. Hopefully things have changed. The management weren't that much of help.
Bank-of-America,1f2nhl2pq2v5r000,2,So much required overtime ,Dispute Resolution Specialist,"I worked in credit card billing disputes. When I started in chargebacks, I felt like I was doing something good, helping customers get their money back from merchants. When I reached the next level, representments, and pre-arbitration after that, I realized that my job was to cover the bank\xe2\x80\x99s a**. When a charge was represented because the chargeback rep screwed up, I had to find a technicality - some tiny thing that the customer did \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d in order to recharge the customer and avoid taking a loss. It was very demoralizing. "
Bank-of-America,1f2meqhf03ki8000,3,A relationship banker is more teller and service tasks than anything else ,Relationship Banker,"Do not let the fancy name fool you. A relationship banker. Is a teller who can \xe2\x80\x9ctheoretically\xe2\x80\x9d open up accounts as well, but the latter primarily goes to relationship managers. There\xe2\x80\x99s a biigggggg difference between relationship manager and bankers. A relationship manager is a somewhat decent job from what I saw. You primarily open accounts, such as credit cards, checking etc. A relationship banker, is basically just a teller that can do everything. But tends to just do the tedious aspects of each role. I was lucky and my team was great. But the job was misleading. "
Bank-of-America,1f2lvqeig3h8b000,4,"Colleagues are wonderful. Management, not so much.",Assistant Vice President,"You will have a hard time finding a workplace culture similar to BOA. I have been in the industry almost 20 years, at various organizations, and I have never experienced this level of comaraderie. Unfortunately, a lot of the departments have skilled managers who lack leadership skills. A subordinate may develop anxiety from top management, which is understandable considering the sensitive nature and high regulation of the industry, so it is, somewhat, expected. The managers seem more task oriented than people; for some, this is unfortunate because it is obvious they are not naturally task oriented. In short, the people manipulators rise while the people influencers sit somewhere in the middle, just not with a senior level responsibility. "
Bank-of-America,1f2l0lto22v5r000,1,Politics ,Relationship Manager / Loan Officer,Quick to point the finger. Boa takes zero accountability it puts all the weight on employees and zero Fs are given. High expectations you will only achieve if you\xe2\x80\x99re placed in the right location. Abundance of unspoken politics that when pointed out are just ignored but continue 
Bank-of-America,1f2krkv1iu1v3800,4,Great people but poor management,Financial Advisor,Colleagues were great. Tasks interesting and we learn from each other. Benefits are great. The management was poor though: no consideration of employees as human being but just as means to reach objectives. 
Bank-of-America,1f2hel84ehim2800,1,Good Luck,Sales and Service Representative,"This company doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pay much, constantly charges customers unnecessary fees, and has a culture that enforces how little importance low level workers are."

Bank-of-America,1f2aajde8him2800,3,Good opportunities,AVP,Overall it is a good place to work. There are opportunities to learn and advance. The downside is there is a lot of inefficiencies and people who do not know what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing.

Bank-of-America,1f279it6b3h8b000,2,Unprofessional Management,Teller/Customer Service Representative,"It may be it was just at my location, but the manager abused the authority. The work environment was unhealthy and different from what it was portrayed to be before I accepted the position. The employees, especially the manager, loved to gossip and talk bad about each other. The manager didn't set a good example, and played favorite. "
Bank-of-America,1f25ri24a2v5r000,2,They overwork you and don’t pay you enough ,Operations Manager,It\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to move up. You have to know someone. Management is like a mafia; and they take care of each other regardless of what they are doing is wrong. 
Bank-of-America,1f25250e9him2800,3,Depends on what department you're in,SMALL BUSINESS BANKER,"BofA really depends on the department you're in. I am in small business and our current leadership is all about driving huge volume with heavy sales pressure to perform. We are all sales people in my group so we want to succeed, but management consistently tells us we are failing our objectives. Everything is telephone/web based now. Management even watches us make phone calls over webcam to ensure we're dialing. However other departments have been great and very fun to work for. But the pressure in small business is really bad. Forcing most on my team to quit or take a leave of absence. We're so understaffed from people quitting we can't keep banking centers open. "
Bank-of-America,1f24vq12shim2800,1,Medical issues- they dont support especially if you took medical leave of absence ,Customer Relationship Manager/Loan Modification Specialist,It was a good company until I had to take medical leave for surgery and other medical down time.

Bank-of-America,1f21kv9chu1v3800,1,Stay away for your mental health,Relationship Manager,"Initially signed up for the financial advisor development program with Merrill lynch. On day one I found out I\'d be working as a relationship manager for ""9 months"", which turned into a lot longer. Their idea was to gain experience with customers first but in reality they just needed people to fill the positions since most people leave after finding out what the job entails. They sell you that being a relationship manager is about providing financial solutions for clients and show you unrealistic bonus goals for you to make. What they don\'t tell you is that you\'re basically customer service and you have to deal with angry clients all day. What ever terrible banking solutions you have heard of you will deal with on a daily bases. On top of that you have no work life balance. You are told to work on Saturdays and have no set schedule. If you are lucky enough to get a day off during the week you will fall short under 40 hours which is that the bank wants. Only way to get your hours in is to work 6 days a week. On top of this you are beyond stressed out with unrealistic goals. You are expected to sell bank products to angry customers all day. When someone comes in who lost their debit card they don\'t want to talk about getting a new credit card. The biggest part for them is selling credit cards. If you don\'t reach the goals upper management comes down hard on you every week. Also, company only promotes people from outside of the company. I\'ve seen amazing people work very hard for management positions that were hired by people with no experience. Oh and forget about the 15 minute"

Bank-of-America,1f1nvo2t4u40q800,2,Seems like a great idea,Assistant Financial Center Manager,"Paid fairly, for 6 day work weeks. 50 hours on average. Employees are so stressed and broken, i have seen several crying. It's not ok. I would blame covid, but the truth is we are so incredibly understaffed. Is so disappointing. I came from a company that worked me so much. I was hoping for REAL work/life balance. This isn't it."

Bank-of-America,1f1m22qkpo15n800,3,"Great benefits, poor upper management ",Client Service Representative,"Bank of America has awesome benefits, but the upper management is very poor. They pressure you to pressure clients to get credit card or home loans. They make it uncomfortable. "

Unfortunately there are not enough minorities in high places or positions at Bank of America. Most black and brown associates or place in low level positions like customer service, the mail room, proof etc."
Bank-of-America,1f1j84rdhu3hv800,4,Great leadership and company,Associate,"Great place to work, leadership gives very clear direction for the whole company and wants everyone to live their core values in their everyday work. Big focus on learning, involvement, and professional development. Hours can sometimes be long (more so in a WFH environment) but nothing crazy. There are your typical corporate politics and it isn't always clear how to get promoted or move around."
Bank-of-America,1f1iuhgf8nph7800,4,Good place so far,Relationship Banker,"I've been here going on 6 months, been working from home doing learning and such. Haven't had the opportunity to deal with customers yet or open accts but the atmosphere is good. Managers seem to be a pain sometimes. But overall it's good. Only thing is they're way behind in the back for employees. With the app and banking experience it's really good but with employee work it's horrible. Waste too much paper at the line, paper, paper, paper. It's like they don't care to upgrade the systems."
Bank-of-America,1f1h8380cnph7800,4,Great for the resume but lack of growth and opportunity,Senior Financial Analyst,"Bofa internal finance is a hit to the P&L just like the internal finance at any other org. However, prior to RPA software, the headcount was massive. They're actively looking to trim it down without laying people off which is making it impossible to move up. Raises are below inflation (1-2% whereas elsewhere raises would be 3-5%) and bonuses have been the same or worse for years. It's all to do with operating expenses. We are benchmarked to JP Morgan and Citi. If our OP expenses remain the same or go up then it reflects negatively in the stock. "
Bank-of-America,1f1g68a5su4vp800,5,Work Hard Play Hard,Fraud Client Services Representative,"Great company culture. You are fairly compensated, but base pay can be a little higher.

Bank-of-America,1f141kegpn56c800,2,Depends on management,Relationship Banker,"It depends on the manager and upper management really, if you're working in the branch. My manager is totally un-relatable to her employees, and adds on extra unnecessary tasks. Nearly every employee at the branch dislikes her, when she makes mistakes she is not punished, yet the RBs are. There is always something to do, and absolutely no down time. Making 25+ calls a day, taking walkins/scheduled appointments, or some other BS that our manager tacks on.For the amount of stress and sales pressure we are given, we are underpaid. Compared to everybody at the back office who makes more than what we do, we deal with a lot more, and put in a lot more work."

Example, I offer two additional products to deepen the relationship and I'm in trouble for not offering a 3rd.  Also, finding answers to your questions is like looking for a needle in the haystack.  Its easy to fail QA in this job.  My local bank has lower fees.  I feel micromanage as well.  Benefits are good but Mgt needs to relax a bit."

Bank-of-America,1f0n00cmo3o8h000,2,Stuck!,Relationship Banker,"BOA does not provide employees much opportunity to move up within the company, regardless of your qualifications or commitment with the company.  ""Promote from within"" is non-existent in my experience.  Despite having a master\'s degree and being a prior-licensed financial advisor, I was passed over multiple times for higher paying positions that where often given to people with no college education or professional experience; and yes, BOA knew I was interested in those opportunities, but didn\'t want to fill the low-life teller position I would vacate.  Apply for upper positions if you want a real career, because you\'re not going anywhere from there."
Bank-of-America,1f0kddg9usa7q800,3,Sales sales sales ,Client Service Representative,They tell you they want people to grow their careers but they only want people to stay who sell sell sell (EVEN AT THE COST OF EFFICIENCY) because profit is more important than clients or associates.

Great benefits but not well balanced at work. Only 30 minutes lunch if you are lucky to have a lunch. Extremely busy with no help. 
Bank-of-America,1f0h1qn8ao1hv800,2,Compensation doesn't meet the amount of work and responsibilities,Relationship Manager,Compensation doesn't meet the amount of work and responsibilities.

Good manager, great team, everybody on the same page and pulling together. I enjoyed the work environment and the bank benefits are really generous. Then the pandemic hit & everything went haywire. Workloads became unbearable and management was/is constantly adding more and more to the job almost weekly. Most of us spent the last 3 months of 2020 working 100 hrs a week just to stay on top of things, only to see our bonus cut in half (if you were lucky enough to even get one). It's become a sweatshop and everybody I know is looking for another job. Great place for work diversity and at the corporate level the bank supports many of the same social issues I believe in. But at the workforce level, at least in my space, work life balance is a joke. It's all work!!!!"
Bank-of-America,1f0chtl0fhiq9800,1,One of the worst companies I ever worked with,Relationship Manager,"Leaving this company was the best decision I ever made. There was constant drama with the Manager and Asst Manager in their personal lives and no room to grow anywhere. I was a Relationship Banker and took my job seriously and the relationships that I built over the years I was employed. Unfortunately, Management began treating people like they were just money getting added to their checks by constantly pushing products to people who had terrible credit and needed actual guidance in their finances. If you didn\'t offer a product to give the Manager/Asst Manager/Tellers ""Credit"" and then sell it by making the client apply for something no matter their personal financial situation you would get in trouble and then it would get reported to the District Manager and so on. This would result in less than favorable one-on-ones for them to explain how terrible you are doing at your job for not making them money. I was constantly stressed out. When I decided to leave the company the ""friendships"" I had made with each colleague were non-existent. It was such a toxic environment. I can speak for MULTIPLE branches being this way as I had trained and assisted in short staffing throughout Northern VA branch and they were ALLL the same. Because of the sales culture and poor treatment with minimal pay and benefits I would highly advise you to stay clear from this company."

Customer & associate relationships bring fulfillment to the job and shine some positive light into the branches.  BUT, upper level management is quite detached from the day to day realities, their expectations are extremely high with intense pressure from top to bottom.  If you thrive in a chaotic atmosphere that changes daily, enjoy reaching for higher and higher goals, and being compensated for growth that quickly becomes not enough,  then this is the place for you."

Bank-of-America,1evr68c26ocao800,5,Fun workplace ,Customer Service Representative,Was a fun place to work at. Gave plenty of breaks and pay was decent. The training was good in and off the phones. Plenty of opportunity for growth in Mesa AZ area

Bank-of-America,1evpu25c5sa8h800,2,Financial Solution advisor  also known as FSA,Financial Solution Advisor," Bank of America will pay for you to go to Maryland or North Carolina for training.  They will book you in a 5-star hotel and will provide you with free meals.  They will even pay you per diem every day. In other words, you get free meals and per diem.  The training lasts about 5-7 days. The trainers claim that Bank of America has the Best Training Program in the WORLD.   In my opinion, it is below-average training.  I asked other FSA what they think about the training and they said it was below average or average.Most people come out of training and cannot remember what the training was about.  If you are a new FSA but worked in the bank of America as a relationship banker or held other positions in the Bank of America then you have an advantage.  Furthermore, you may succeed as FSA because of that.  But if you are a new FSA and never worked for Bank of America then I wish you good luck. It is a lot of work and pressure on the job.  In other words, this is a high-pressure sales job. Most people cannot remember what the training was about.  Every 2 hours or so there is a 20-30-minute break.   I think the trainers want to finish their duties as soon as they can because they only have 6-7 days to do it  Most people do not learn by just looking.  Most people learn by doing.  But trainers are more concerned with the visual process but not actual hands-on. Remember they have to go over so much stuff so hands-on experience takes time.  Therefore, the visual process is faster.   I think that is why most people are confused.   The FSA computer crashes from time to time.  You need"
Bank-of-America,1evpsv7jcn52h800,4,Great benefits. pretty good overall ,Relationship Manager,"Good place to work. Friendly people. Inclusive. Pay for what you do is ok. Most banking centers are understaffed. BoA cares little for feedback on old complex convoluted systems with constant crashes that make it harder to do your job.As a retail banker, you have aggressive sales quotas but see most clients when they have a simple banking issue (lost debit card etc) which you no longer can do. Management pressures appointments. Branch management is stretched too thin to be effective. "
Bank-of-America,1evo2hq3jocao800,4,Great training and advancement opportunities ,Vice President,"I owe my career to this bank. I went through the Banking Center Management Training program after graduating college (with my Bachelors in Finance). I was promoted many times and after 14 years I switched industries and after 5 years became the CEO of a $150M company. I referred back to what I learned at BoFA from various trainings and the 10 or so managers I had, as well as the tools and approaches they taught me/provided, very often over my career. I definitely think that had I not worked here, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have achieved the same level of success. Of course a lot of this has to do with my individual managers at the bank but they hired great talent so only 2 of the 10 managers I had were not \xe2\x80\x9cinspiring leaders\xe2\x80\x9d and just 1 out of 10 in over 14 years was not qualified to hold the position. The bank has an incredible number of resources that in turn helps you succeed."
Bank-of-America,1evnq4ib8n52h800,2,Soul sucking environment ,Customer Service,"For the most part, BofA is like most call center jobs. I admit they are very generous in their pay and benefits but otherwise this is an extremely toxic environment. From the time I started working there, I felt like I was back in high school. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure most call centers are like this but I guess I had never experienced it. Personal issues aside, the way BofA judges stats is ridiculous. Your job is constantly at stake but then there is little help when you ask for it. I have to admit being able to read some of these reviews has helped me realize I am not the only the one. Customers are awful but that\xe2\x80\x99s what happens in a call center. "
Bank-of-America,1evm0fbffsa8h800,5,Very diverse and fun company to work for,Sales and Service Associate II,"Easy to learn new roles, either through cross training, or assisting other teams within your line of business.Easy to work with in ensuring work life balance."
Bank-of-America,1evikkplss7kr800,1,Terrible staffing,Client Service Representative,"BoA only care about profits and global dominance. Staffing is cut to absolute bare minimum in branches which puts heavy workload, stress, and client complaints at a high, even way before the pandemic."

Bank-of-America,1evhm7uq726a4000,4,Overall Good Company ,Underwriter,"Bank of America is a great company to work for. Although it offers many opportunities to work in different areas, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily offer as much advancement after a certain level. Workload can be heavy but overtime is encouraged, not required. Work life balance can be hard because it\xe2\x80\x99s a stressful job. Management is fair and the echelon in place is effective if followed."

Bank-of-America,1evg7ba36ocao800,4,Very productive job,Branch Manager,Very productive job.  High expectations and make sure your able to keep pace as you will be doing a lot of multitasking.   Hard to deal with teller cuts as lines grow long with angry customers.
Bank-of-America,1evg0d1jtocao800,4,Wonder place to work,Claim Analyst II,Amazing place to work if you work in the right department. My first year was stressful being on the phone but after that. I set a meeting with my manager regarding my future career with BofA and within two years I was able to achieve the position I wanted.

Bank-of-America,1eve7d723ocao800,1,"Great Benefits - Micro Managed, coddled, and fake",Preferred Sales Account Manager,"The benefits are good. Even after sales pressure allegations they quantify  sales conducive conversations and will coach you out if you arent having the ""right conversation"". If you are cliqued up with management after drinking the kool aid  they will find alternative routes for you to take. NOT TRUE COMMISION. They will hold their commision structure until the day before you hit the floor live. They are a bank and are their to make money. I can go on and on. If you are hungry for making money, either sales or salaried, I would say look elsewhere. "
Bank-of-America,1eve5epoiocao800,1,Terrible Employer!!,Personal Banker,"This was the WORST employment experience of my life. If you do not meet the sales goals you will be terminated. You are treated as just another number and they really don\'t care about employee well-being, it\'s all about forcing sales on the customer. It doesn\'t matter what you do to get the sale...you just have to get it. They also give a generous vacation balance each year but when you try to schedule a vacation your job is threatened. They tell you ""go ahead and schedule that time off but, just remember.... you are going to be missing your sales!"" Horrible place to work! I left in tears nearly everyday."

Bank-of-America,1evchrsknt5h3800,2,Meh!,Director,"Middle of the road place, favoritism for those selected as leaders-not a lot of upside for the average employee, salary very stagnant after a point. Big diversity push and pretty good community engagement."

Bank-of-America,1evafa7d9n55l800,3,Overwhelming not long enough breaks,Client Service Representative,Very stressful. Demanding and not enough support or encouragement.

Bank-of-America,1ev9cn6aqnpna800,5,Great Pay! Awesome Benefits! ,Fraud Analyst,The bank has amazing benefits and a really good pay. The minimum wage is $20.00 no matter what position you start at. In my position as fraud analyst you are expected to constantly take phone calls and if you even think of going to the restroom or simply taking a breather in between think again. The job itself is not hard but it can be draining to take calls back to back to back without being to even take a deep breath in between. They have excellent benefits that would be hard to beat elsewhere. 
Bank-of-America,1ev95avv1n55l800,2,ok,research and adjustment III,the benefits are good. once you are there for a year you can move to another position. the changes seem unnecessary but it is leadership structure that influences that.

Bank-of-America,1ev3gb7j7npjs800,2,Numbers are important,CSR - Customer Service Representative,Sales are their main priority so you have to make sure you meet your goals if you want to stay. They were not flexible with scheduling so expect to work 6 days a week most of the time. They don\xe2\x80\x99t give the mandatory breaks every two hours a lot of the time and will ask you to come back from lunch early if there is a line (which is always). 
Bank-of-America,1ev33da41t5ho800,5,Great place to work ,Relationship Manager,I had a wonderful experience working at BOA and learned so much from my management team. I would absolutely recommend BOA for a job if you are ever interested in banking.

Bank-of-America,1eut73jt2npna800,4,Good benefits but hard to advance,Customer Service & Sales Specialist I,"The bank offers very good benefits I must admit and they pay well. Retail pays less than the call center. It's your typical call center job. Calls are very busy and normally back to back. Must be flexible for schedule bids and changes. I started in mortgage and we were all moved to credit card. Hard to advance to other positions, however you will be told otherwise. The job will be what you make it. They do a background check and run fingerprints. I was not drug tested."
Bank-of-America,1eurbtuml3h99000,5,Fun work place with clear and fair expectations,Senior Fraud Analyst,"My time at Bank of America was pleasant.

But with the pandemic going on, I dislike having to call clients regarding their financial needs. And being very pushy with communicating with clients when all of the employees are doing their best. Other banks to do pressure their employees these tactics because its very distasteful and we continue to bother our clients. "

Bank-of-America,1euoj4vdeo15p800,4,Productive and busy workplace,Teller/(CSR) Customer Service Representative,"Work and life balance was good but there was a lot of demand for sales as a teller and it's hard to sell when there is a long line of customers waiting to be helped. Sales was the main part of the roll believe it or not. The pay is okay hourly for tellers but there is no compensation for sales but there are goals that you have to reach and if you do not reach them you can get a write up. Management is a hit or miss, I loved all mine but it's part of their job to push sales and make you read a certain script so it was a little frustrating. Definably loved working there for the expire and interacting with all the different clients but the sales killed it for me! The more clients you see the more is expected of you even if you're the only teller on the line, SALES SALES SALES (no compensation). "

I worked in an operational, production environment so the day-to-day was mundane but the expectations were clearly defined. Bank of America has a lot of opportunities to advance and the employees are coveted by other companies in the industry, so if you want to venture out, you will have that option available to you if decide to leave company. "
Bank-of-America,1etkvkd3vu312800,1,Great place to learn and take your skills elsewhere,Lending Officer,Resources are there to learn a lot about the mortgage business on your own. Do not expect much help or guidance from anyone else. Management is there to strictly micromanage. They adopted a business plan to convert all Loan Officers into hybrid bankers by giving us additional responsibilities in the bank totally unrelated to mortgage loans. They also obliterated our base plus commission plus bonus pay forcing us to work for a measly salary with an improbable bonus plan. Only those with super powers and menial budgets need apply. 
Bank-of-America,1etkv8dbio29g800,4,Huge corporation - decisions and policies are made on an international level. VERY “progressive”- leaning ideals.,Registered Client Service Associate,"Generally a good place to work. I have had better and worse. They would do better to focus on client service which would make people want to do business with them, instead of the sole focus of profit. Merrill Lynch used to be a great company, but Bank of America has continued to infiltrate their business model for the worse."
Bank-of-America,1etj2er5uo29g800,5,Good place to work for young professionals,Relationship Manager,"This is a good place to start for young professionals. There are a variety of different jobs and lines of business, you can make moves laterally and upwards based on skill, manager reviews and perfomance. The most important part is how they have treated us during covid-19. Cut hours but not pay, given us bonuses even durning covid even if you didn't hit your goals and no lay offs. "
Bank-of-America,1etj1ebr8u312800,4,Good to get your feet wet,Registered Client Associate,Great role for an introduction to wealth management. After that there is not much upward mobility unless you become a Financial Advisor or find a team that is willing to add you on as a specialist.

They wont move you up and the work you to death and wont hire any help they just move people around to fill voids for 30 minutes.

Rub elbows with the right people and you will advance."
Bank-of-America,1etg44m10oslj800,1,Low pay,Mortgage Loan Processor,The company under pay you and lower your bonuses quarterly if not annually.  They do not care if you are not working in upper management and the upper love to micromanage. 
Bank-of-America,1etdieurkt48t800,4,overall a decent company to work for,Direct Auto Lending Loan Officer,"Job itself is not difficult at all, but workload is consistently growing. More of the responsibilities are seem to fall under the loan officer. Can be stressful due to delays in processing and funding. Work experience with the company can also differ based upon manager. Upper management cares about production more than their actual employees. "

However, life is stressful and you\xe2\x80\x99ll encounter a lot of managers who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t care less about your career or you as a person.

Bank-of-America,1et5dtisrpi26800,3,"Great Benefits, training not so much",Mortgage Loan Closer/Funder,"The job could be better if the training was better. Especially while working from home and not having access to others for help. The role requires slot of work, but you feel defeated when you can\xe2\x80\x99t produce due to not knowing the job well. The benefits are some of the best"
Bank-of-America,1et4uhopft48t800,5,"Co-workers are awesome, flexibility in many ways",Mortgage Loan Coordinator,"You are not micromanaged, management is helpful if they are not super busy. Teammates are very helpful. Great environment! Flexibility with time needed to be off."

I really enjoyed working here when I did and starting pay was decent for me as I was a student at the time. They provide benefits even if you work part time so that was also a huge plus. "
Bank-of-America,1esudml16npps800,2,Tough for me,Small business credit card customer service representative,"Lot's of interaction with customers, but almost no time off the phone.

Bank-of-America,1esrval85t4lr800,5,Productive,Housekeeper,"Working here is pretty typical of most rehab companies where you treat your patients and then go home.

Bank-of-America,1esr2819su3cn800,3,Performance was never enough.,Financial Advisor,Goals were continually adjusted in favor of the company.  Culture was not favorable to the team.  Too much consultant speak.  Management had no idea of who their employees were.  Employees were treated as cogs.
Bank-of-America,1esqmk9cku3cn800,4,Great company ,Fraud Specialist,"BOA is a great company, but they are moving to a one stop shop with all their agents, blending them with different skills for different departments however the pay for it is the same as a agent with one skill. You are overworked and underpaid. Since covid we have to talk to our managers virtually and they are really of no help at all while home. They\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten lazy. "
Bank-of-America,1esqi0n82u3cn800,4,Must enjoy what you do. ,Professional Teller,"I enjoyed talking to the clients at bank of America. Giving back to the community was fun.

Bank-of-America,1esp10tkbnpic800,2,Horrible management but good benefits ,Customer Service Representative,"They have great benefits and good pay, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth the BS you have to put up with. They are understaffed. You are constantly stressed and requesting a day off, forget it. Been there for 5 years and get two weeks of PTO. That\xe2\x80\x99s great but you can\xe2\x80\x99t break up PTO. You can only take it a week at time. The management is horrible, rude, condescending and easily replace you. Want a promotion ? Forget about it. Empty promises "
Bank-of-America,1esns1ntfu31u800,5,BOA is a great company to work for,Market growth leader,BOA was an excellent company to Work for. This includes management and all staff. Promotions are always available to you. They care and want you to succeed in your career.

Bank-of-America,1eslir2d5t4lr800,1,Nothing good,Collection Specialist I,"I thought going into the position it was going to be great, WRONG SO WRONG! Management cares only of themselves and the ones who they play favorites to. Extremely disappointed with the way they treat people who are really doing a great job at their position. Management is such a joke. High n mighty attitudes and no true knowledge of how to actually perform their rolls. Definitely look down on contractors, and will drag them forever with false hope of what they signed up for. I wouldn't advise people to apply, not only myself but many others I know from there feel the same as I do, and probably worse about their time with BANK OF AMERICA. "
Bank-of-America,1esl9gf2mu3cn800,4,Solid and Reputable Company ,Customer Service Representative,Hired through contract agency. They promised retention and conversion to permanent role with company within 9-12 months or LESS. Coming up on a year and nothing really. Name recognition and reputation of a major bank of course. But bare essentials of a call center. Good if you can handle fast pace and lots of calls and performance metrics. But can be stressful 
Bank-of-America,1esl7plf6npcv800,5,Great culture,BUSINESS EXECUTIVE MANAGER,Good place to build a career. Great benefits and work culture. Sometimes it does feel corporate too much but most co workers were great. Lots of opportunities for career advancement if you put the work into it. 
Bank-of-America,1esk3fbm1npic800,5,Teller,Teller/Customer Service,Working at Bank of America is really a shift from the smaller mom and pop businesses that I worked at before. They provide really great affordable benefits even if you are a part time worker. There is plenty of opportunity to move up in the company if you work hard enough. At the beginning of the pandemic they were paying an extra $200 covid pay and still provide free lunch every day. The only slight down side is that if they hire you as a part time worker and work you fill time.  They will only give you vacation and sick pay for part time which is unethical but I guess I can\xe2\x80\x99t complain too much with all the other benefits. 
Bank-of-America,1esjuldbpu31u800,5,Great company to work for!,Portfolio Manager Associate,It was a great place to work until new management came in! Some of the coworkers were difficult to work with & management played favorites! Very stressful the last few years!
Bank-of-America,1esi9mvajnpic800,4,Overall great company ,Relationship Banker,Most Financial Managers don\xe2\x80\x99t do enough anymore. They more or less watch you do their jobs for them and take credit. If you do get an active manager they\xe2\x80\x99re usually great but you\xe2\x80\x99ll get help from peers all the same. Job security is there and you get paid nicely. Promotions vary from person to person. Others that work hard for years may be stuck in their role. While others get promotions after a year of being with the company. 
Bank-of-America,1esh6t2mtu3lm800,5,Workplace ,Client Services Representative II (Credit Card & Deposits),"It was a great first corporate job.

Bank-of-America,1es6eur5at4l3800,4,Stable work place - Reasonable Pay - inflexible work arrangements,Database Administrator,"The company is basically a good place to work.  Good benefits and most managers truly care about their people. The thing that seems to be going backwards is the WFH situation.  The company doesn't want anyone working from home and is monitoring how often you come into the office.  Of course, there are people that this doesn't seem to apply to so it causes alot of riff among the employees.  Hopefully, the company will eventually go back to some work from home program.  But in the meantime, if you are planning on working for Bank of America, plan to be in the office 5 days a week sitting in your cubicle.  "

Bank-of-America,1errvq03bu2h8800,1,CHEDR Group has a hostile culture,Technical Business Analyst,"The quality of the deliverables from this group is getting worse and worse. Instead of a professional discussion to work together and understand the issues, the manager(s) yell and use negative reinforcement to discuss the next deliverables. It was a shock to me until they began yelling at me when I fell behind on work. For a complex application, I was given a short time to become an expert. The abuse was disappointing. This was my 3rd project with the Bank and the other 2 projects were excellent."

BUT, they have not adjusted the metrics for what we have been dealing with for the past year.  They have very strict AHT times, with lots of software issues, lots of customer complaints that need to be documented, lots of disputes because of COVID and a huge uprise in fraud that all have to be documented for each caller along with servicing the customer's other needs while getting it all done in under 5-6 minutes, the exact number depends on the department you are in.  They also have a lot of vendors that are hoping to become permanent employees and if seasoned employees have trouble meeting the metrics, almost impossible for the newbies.  Employees who had no issues before are now struggling to meet it.  Well over half of the call center agents are currently failing the AHT part of the metrics.    "

As soon as one call ends there is another call in your ear. Customers are calling to complain and your job is to sell them something, while they're upset.

Looks good on resume as people say they work for Bank of America or Bank of America/Merril Lynch. Got to travel across the US and stay at cool locations and peers got to travel internationally. The class you come in with are pretty close and have lifelong connections.

If you\xe2\x80\x99re a hard worker driven to succeed you will advance as well as make good money within the organization. Bank of America truly pays for performance.

Bank-of-America,1epkgppoeo215800,5,Great Employer with Excellent Pay,VP Product Management,"Bank of America is often overlooked as a premier employer, but should absolutely be on the radar of every professional in any industry.  I've worked at some of the most respected companies and brands in the world and none of them compare, everything inclusive, to Bank of America.  The industry can be slow moving, but Bank of America excels in growth opportunities, compensation and benefits.  Include the flexibility to work from nearly anywhere in the country and you have the one of the top employers in the world tip to tail.  It would take something significant to get me to even consider moving to another company."

As time passes managers are always busy and you may not get the help you need the time you need it. Ex: customer has a issue u need a manager assistance but no one is available, u may have the client on hold for awhile which affects your stats, but your waiting for assistance.  Calls back to back can be challenging but once u develop a routine you will be ok. "
Bank-of-America,1epi7mqlqt4h0800,2,terrible management ,Relationship Banker,terrible training and terrible management . They do not train you properly and just throw you out on the floor having no clue what your doing.

When searching for which career path to take, reaching out and hearing back has been solid. I've enjoyed the training academies too as it allows me to learn the back office culture as well."
Bank-of-America,1ephl99u9u3bh800,5,"Growth potential, great benefits & compensation package, very professional",Senior Operations Manager,this is the best job that I have ever had. I started out at the bottom and even took a cut in pay for this job but it was well worth it. I was promoted to supervisor after a year and after two years in supervision was promoted to management and then within a year upper management. the schedule was great along with wonderful people to work with and a very positive working environment. very professional and had a great deal of support from corporate. really hated that the housing division closed because it was a wonderful career! 
Bank-of-America,1epg7lbqst4h0800,4,"Fun place to work, room for growth",Financial Center Lending Officer,Great place to work if you are a top performer. Sometimes feels like lower/middle tier producers get left behind by management/are not favored. Company does indeed care about it's employees overall though.
Bank-of-America,1epfsr2rsnpl6800,1,Poor management with no opportunity for growth.,Bank Teller,"During my time with this company, I worked at two different locations. I requested to be transferred from the first location in hopes that the management would be better. Unfortunately, the management at both locations was similar. They did not offer much guidance and were often condescending toward customers and employees. We were understaffed throughout the day (customers complained about this frequently). The environment was very fast-paced and stressful. Benefits were offered to full-time employees. Weekly hours for part-time employees were irregular. Tellers stood the entire duration of their shifts (no chairs/stools were provided). The wage/salary for tellers and bankers was low despite all of the responsibilities. The rest of my co-workers and I made the best out of it and helped each other. Overall, I wouldn't recommend working for Bank of America unless you need to gain 1-2 years of experience and are willing to deal with the daily headaches."
Bank-of-America,1epf9itkr2v69000,4,Simple work,Fraud Servicing Specialist,"Working for Bank of America is certainly pleasant. The pay is great and the manager support is always helpful. It does depend on the manager you have, however, which does tend to change. Through 10 months I\xe2\x80\x99ve had three different managers and two different teams so there is a lot of movement. There\xe2\x80\x99s also opportunity to promote or change departments if you meet yearly goals. The pay is good, great benefits and you work from home. Overall it is a great job but there are still many things that can make it challenging. Calls don\xe2\x80\x99t stop, so if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind talking to customers all day, happy or upset, then the job will be a breeze. You also have to maintain an average handle time on calls, push surveys and many other merits for every call. "
Bank-of-America,1epapk8n8u38g800,4,"Great benefits, decent pay, frustrating back-end processes",Financial Center Lending Officer,"Direct manager is fantastic and really cares. Back-end support, underwriting, processors are YMMV - all depends on luck of the draw who you get. Compensation structure changes all the time....not what I signed up for to begin with."
Bank-of-America,1ep8mi677npl6800,5,I loved working here they will definitely take care of you.,Customer Service Representative II,The environment was phenomenal and they were always there to help you. If you had a question they'd go through the steps to help you find the answer so if the situation came up again you knew how to get there again. The people were just amazing.
Bank-of-America,1ep6ctd51t4it800,2,"Unprofessional, disrespectful, and extremely prejudiced ",Collector,Never promoted and promised advancements that were never received . This place is very difficult to work for and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend collecting for anyone. Not to mention the hours are horrible 
Bank-of-America,1ep5p6hsenpl6800,4,Upper management needs to be booted,Project Manager/Doctor Loans ,"The job I had was fairly easy, but was stressful especially towards the end of the month.  My immediate boss was great, but upper management was stuck in old school ways refusing to progress with the times.  No matter what suggestions were given by the employees doing the job in current times, they refused to change.  They were stuck in their know it all ways from back when they did the job decades ago.  They need to do undercover boss to see how far removed they are from reality with the current times.  There is no progression with those men in place.  HR was called to report inappropriate behavior as well, but HR was useless, and did nothing as usual.  The job itself though was easy, the benefits were great, and there are plenty of jobs you can transfer to once you put in one year at whatever position you are in. Also, if you are related to anybody in management, regardless if you are right out of college with no experience, you will get paid more than all the others with years of experience.  "
Bank-of-America,1ep5hesfqt4it800,5,"Worked for Merrill Lynch, excellent company ",Financial Advisor - Assistant Vice President,I am sad I no longer work for this institution.

Bank-of-America,1ep4fd10bt4it800,2,Great to get your foot in the door with banking!,Teller / Banker,"a typical workday includes : Arriving early, counting cash and setting up for customers. Here i learned that money is more important then employees and thats just what it is. I also learned alot about banking through great training programs i was provided while employed.Management was not good as they did not lead nor listen and act on employees concerns to make a comfortable workplace. Instead instilled fear i its employees. Workplace culture was okay. It all depends on personality. The work place was not diverse. Hardest art of the job was not feeling supported by management, but often criticized and pushed to reach numbers and goals with no reward but lots of scolding along the way. The most nejoyable part of the job was the few customers that were regulars that cared. That remembered previous conversations, childrens birthdays etc."
Bank-of-America,1ep4e7qph2v69000,1,Lots of quality but frustrated people ,COMMERCIAL LENDING OFFICER,"Sweatshop culture where teammates assisting each other is frowned upon and where management assistance/training is nonexistent.

If you don\xe2\x80\x99t already know everything you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to do for BofA then don\xe2\x80\x99t come to work here."

Always had a fear they will let you go anytime. They say they are helping you. But honestly they are not. Its not ok for regular indexers to make the mistake.

Bank-of-America,1ep0r5ja0npim800,3,Highly stressful work environment/ good benefits ,Customer Service Specialist II,"The benefits is what stood out to me in this job. The pay wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good at all for the type of stress this job gives you. I was very unhappy here for the 3 years that I was working here. I\xe2\x80\x99m thankful I found something better. Everything else needs some improvement. The work environment was a little hostile. Management played a lot of favoritism. Some managers didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to do their job. If you wanted a promotion you would have to go out an make it happen for yourself which could be a good character building practice. However, you would see that ones that would get promoted directly from the managers were always the favorites. This would happen even if you were an excellent employee. Overall not a great working experience at Bank of America, however the benefits were okay. "

The hybrid culture for the next year is a pro (in office 3 days a week). Biggest cons were the compensation and the location. My compensation started a high base but barely increased after that.

I would recommend networking a lot because it will be useful to you later on. Sometimes they give you enough work, but sometimes they don't, it depends on the teams you're on since they greatly differ. "
Bloomberg,1fhc8cgtau1hk802,4,Good time,Hi-Lo Driver,Money was good lunches were great but management wasn't so great. Some people don't like to work independently but I hope you had to get them out of the company. 
Bloomberg,1fh9ikglgu2l5800,5,Intelligent and amazing colleagues ,Customer Service Representative,"It's very fast paced environment, everyone (at least on my team) is all working at their maximum capacity, but it could get quite stressful.Although the company is big, but it still have the start-up vibe. People really cares about your accomplishments. If you are confident and competitive, this is a perfect place for you to succeed. "
Bloomberg,1fh135ja4t499800,3,"Great people, poor advancement opportunities ",Undisclosed ,Benefits are first in class. Lots of opportunities to learn and collaborate cross-functionally. Unconvnentional thinking is not supported. Female leadership is underdeveloped. Lack of career progression. 
Bloomberg,1fgiltt0rs7mv802,1,Archaic culture ,Project Manager,No flexibility with wfh.  Need to update systems. Archaic culture.  Offices are pretty but it feels like one big trading floor.  Micromanagement is everywhere 
Bloomberg,1fg9v4rl3u412801,2,Nice facilities and employees,Analyst,"Bloomberg has very nice facilities and amenities but it can very much feel like you are working at a high tech sweatshop. Very demanding, long hours, having to commute during a pandemic are big cons. "
Bloomberg,1fg78vrs7s7mv801,2,Great place if you are starting out,Financial Analyst,"Very young vibe and a lot of freebies.  Free snacks (healthy and not-so-healthy), drinks and they provide food for breakfast and lunch.  Like most companies, your experience depends on what management chain you work for.  Very fast paced and demanding, but at times undermined the sense of teamwork and focuses more on individuals.  The pay and the exposure was good."
Bloomberg,1ff9ihtoou3a4802,4,"Get in, Get out",Financial Analyst,Worked as a temp here and it was fine.  Though be aware there is very little chance you can get moved up to a full time offer.   If you can't code then you definitely won't be hired full time.
Bloomberg,1fd28g5dd3h80002,4,"Great place to work, even if it has gotten too big",Tech,"I've been working here for 20 years.  In the beginning, it was a much smaller company and movement/job opportunities within was easy. Now that it has gotten too big, it's more like any big company with everything having to go through HR.  Pay is definitely on the higher end compared to most other companies and vacation/sick time is top notch.Overall, a great company to work for."
Bloomberg,1fcgqnddnt4mk800,1,This company will never learn,Analyst,"Bloomberg is great when it comes to pay and benefits. Compared to most other companies I have seen, the vacation, sick, leave time, and other misc benefits are pretty generous. If you find the right group of coworkers, they can literally make an otherwise horrible day bearable. Sadly, that is just about where it ends. Getting even minor things done (such a programming enhancements, implementing task efficiencies) can be impossible. Their infrastructure is held together with duct tape and bubblegum and their business managers are only interested in getting the next shiny new thing to market; never mind if it's buggy and doesn't work. The company, as a whole, also does not value its employees at all. They are just cogs in the machine. If one leaves, they just get replaced. HR doesn't care to understand why, or address ongoing issues because they can simply find someone else. Pretty sad because a lot of the older employees, who literally helped to build and shape the company, are treated pretty badly and the new ones, fresh out of college, tend to come in, stay a few years, then leave. Work-life balance is terrible and the company lacks any reasonable amount of flexibility. The company has actually grown in the past year and a half, with most employees working remotely. But they still won't even consider allowing anyone to continue to do so, even if means much happier and more productive employees. This is extra ridiculous because of the global nature of the company. People in many roles work remotely from their coworkers anyway (ie most of my direct coworkers, I have"

Bloomberg,1fb31n5phhije802,4,"good pay/benefits, security, smart ppl, but culture lacking",News Editor/Reporter,"In many ways Bloomberg is a model place to work-ethical culture, perks and benefits, well-organized. But news dept is very hit or miss. No strong vision or leadership, pay lip service to work-life balance but lot of top down mismanagement and long hours. Fire great people and keep incompetent ones.  Cut back resources but add work to workload and expect same level of performance. Uninspiring."
Bloomberg,1fajlkus5sa6u800,4,Was an amazing place but the times have chnaged. ,Reporter,I've had a fantastic ride at Bloomberg for the last 10 years. Generally it's been a fun innovative company to work for and a great brand to be under. Over the last 3 years it's been very clearly they are prepping to sell. Headcount have shrieked while additional work has been added. Work/life balance is awful and they are not flexible on wfh. It's a great legacy but it's best years are past it.

Burlington-Stores,1f3qshi5gu1vt800,4,Good hourly wage job,Cashier,Worked as a cashier and the pay was pretty good and the people were nice. Just had this job to make some money in the summer. Sometimes they asked me to do things not in my job description which was fine. Management was fairly nice. 
Burlington-Stores,1flhi0ui1n5co801,2,Overworked and low pay,Recieving Associate,"Understaffed, little support from management. Hours say one thing, managers another. Holding me for an hour extra to finish my work. If your mentally and physically capable, you will quickly get used to the job. "

I loved the fast pace because it made the day go by quicker, and the discounts for all of the stuff they sell were a bonus! The stores are closed on holidays, but they give ot pay that counts on the day before and day after as well. My coworkers were hard working and most very friendly, especially when it came to closing and supporting each other when we needed assistance. I left for personal reasons, but I would definitely work at that location again!  "
Burlington-Stores,1fldjp023ocrn802,2,Was different from any previous job,Flex Time Associate,"Didn't work the position I was hired for. Wasn't trained for the position I was hired for. Hiring manager tried to get me more hours; however, hours were not good."

Burlington-Stores,1flclq07qocrn802,1,Awful ,Recieving Associate,"Just so many cons about working here. Blatant favoritism, awful schedules and a super messy and disorganized store. You\xe2\x80\x99re expected to do a lot for a poor pay check. They make you work different departments even if it\xe2\x80\x99s not what you applied for.  If there\xe2\x80\x99s anything good about working here it\xe2\x80\x99s just the employee discount. It\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder why new associates don\xe2\x80\x99t last here!"
Burlington-Stores,1flbr67hcn59v802,1,Work Environment ,Sales Associate,"Use to be a great place to work. The company use to care about the recovery of the stores. Not no more.

Burlington-Stores,1fl80sambu1l4801,4,Nice first time job,Cashier,"Good management, you can have flexible hours, but the company doesn't reward people for staying. Part-time employees can have dental and vision insurance."

Burlington-Stores,1fl7cdi4hs7is800,5,Friendly and courteous to each other as employee's ,Receiving Associate,"I learned how to put buttons on the hangers with clothes, stalk shelves and hang merchandise on the sales floor, loading the carts with merchandise to put on the sales floor, working on hanging and putting on the security tags on clothes and other merchandise in receiving. Learning to be able to complete everything each day.Everyone gets along, friendly, and helpful when how to do something.The hardest part of this is my only problem is being able to be able to get to work when I am offered the hours that are assigned to me.The most enjoyable part of the job is working at Burlington because it is fun and I get the 15%-30% and hourly pay at $13.50. Also I get along with everyone and I like working there."
Burlington-Stores,1fl6mag3cn5co800,4,Great associates!,Store Manager,There is a great camaraderie with associates from every level.  As a SM you manage the total store.  Most of your time is spent on hiring and gauging how well the freight is completed on a 24 hour basis.  The work-life balance in this retail climate is not very good and you have to continuously check in with the store to assess every situation.   
Burlington-Stores,1fl514nd2n59v802,3,Ugh,Cashier,"Although the managers and my coworkers were good people, we were chronically understaffed and overworked with no increase in pay to compensate. The company would benefit from allowing stores to hire enough staff to actually perform all job duties, instead of underhiring to ""cut costs."" "
Burlington-Stores,1fl4e2b9mn59v802,3,Run of the mill retail,Keyholder,"Worked at a good store with good employees and management. Stay away from store gossip or drama and you'll be fine.  I advanced rather quickly and got promoted before someone with seniority which ruffled a few feathers but I kept my head down and did my job. Easy work overall, the worst part is obviously the customers and use of the fitting rooms, theft/tag switching, trying to bully register workers into discounts etc. Typical retail in an urban area even with security posted at the front entrance "
Burlington-Stores,1fku53o4hn5co801,5,Friendly and nice place to work,Receiving,"I like working in the back in receiving. The work that I do I complete every day is good. I can keep up with the work in the back and what needs to be done. Every day that I work I either Hang clothes with a security code, put on the proper size button, price merchandise, and put it on the sales floor."
Burlington-Stores,1fktffsfbs7is802,1,Disorganized workplace,Backroom Associate,"NOT easy. Fast pace because it\xe2\x80\x99s forced. Rushing is what makes this job hard. You sort your assigned clothing and miscellaneous items out of the box; sticker it, target it, sensor it, size it, put it on a cart/rack and it gets taken out. Each cart/rack has a specific location, read the tag/ sticker and take it to the area its assigned. Tags/stickers are abbreviated, it take awhile to remember what every abbreviation is and where it gos. TONS to remember "
Burlington-Stores,1fkt54pffs7is802,1,Worst place to work at ,Cashier/Receiving Associate,The people here are rude and it\xe2\x80\x99s your very own manager they do NOT care about their employees and have no common sense. The pay is too low to deal with the mangers they are so rude to the employees which is why so many people quit that job
Burlington-Stores,1fkrebpqmt4vo802,1,Disorganized and company focuses solely on sales ,Supervisor,"I worked for Burlington for four years and it has been the worst retail experience with any employer within my six years in the retail industry. During my time working with Burlington, we continuously experienced a staffing shortage, as the rate of pay started at $9.00 hourly despite the competitive wages from other retailers on top of awful workload -  so we were never able to keep enough people throughout the holidays and busier times of year. Management team weren\xe2\x80\x99t team oriented and unconcerned with maintenance of sales floor , rather just focused on sales - as a result employee moral is terrible,  team lacks sense of accountability, no one is concerned with maintaining appearance of store, customer service isn\xe2\x80\x99t a priority, as a result the store is always a mess, staff members are overworked and angry. "
Burlington-Stores,1fkrccqlrn59v802,2,"poor attendance keeping system, 0 to no advancement, good monthly discount. ",Receiving Clerk,"On a typical day at work, an associate will first clock in and their badge might say, not scheduled or too early. This error message will no longer qualify them for perfect attendance for the month. Then there is the point system they can still use to fire you with.   "
Burlington-Stores,1fkr12509ocrn801,3,Stressful,Sales Associate,"Stressful not enough help and too much to do. Lines are always long so expect to be a cashier even if hired for sales floor. Actually, unless you're backroom you can expect to work basically every position including putting out stock if you're sales floor. Also expect petty customers and getting blamed for petty customer grievances. "
Burlington-Stores,1fkqu9nuvt4vo801,3,Management ,Cashier/Sales Associate,"The employees were cool, but the Supervisor DID NOT care about employees\xe2\x80\x99 feelings whatsoever. And good luck asking for a day off, the supervisor would question you so much on why you need a day off. "
Burlington-Stores,1fkpsutu6o1e7802,3,A very mid-job ,Associate,"The environment is very clique-y. People aren't that friendly, and anytime someone would talk to you it would be to talk poorly about management. Most of the time you are assigned a section to fix throughout your whole shift and given no direction beyond that. It was very boring. "
Burlington-Stores,1fko0lsa0u1hp800,3,ok place to work at,Store Associate,Typical day at Burlington would be packing the racks and helping the customers. If the customer need help finding a item  we will assist them. Then you will go on you're lunch break.
Burlington-Stores,1fkn53t58269p001,3,the most enjoyable part about cleaning up at the end of the shift for the start of a new day.,Flow Team Member,Being an employee for the first time at a store you were once a customer at gives a whole new perspective on the effort companies put in to ensure and fulfill customers\xe2\x80\x99 needs and desires. It makes you appreciate shopping a little more when you become a regular customer once again.
Burlington-Stores,1fkmcmervu1hp802,1,"Understaffed, undervalued, and Very low pay",Cashier/Sales Associate,"Very fast paced, lack of training, managers don't communicate with each other and lack of acknowledge, teamwork and goal completion, poor management and on busy days they won't give me breaks and became unhappy with my hours, always closing at night. Some coworkers often procrastinate and be on their phones. Customers always complain and make the job more difficult when returning items without receipts. And most of all, very low pay for big responsibilities."
Burlington-Stores,1fklggs6mt5bp802,2,Average Retail Job,Cashier,Working at Burlington is an average retail job. Managers only care if you ring up people and go above and beyond. They will work you to death if they could.

Burlington-Stores,1fkcla0j9t52e802,1,Overworked and underpaid,Recieving Associate,"Overworked and underpaid. You get the best hours if you work in the receiving department, especially during the holidays. However, that comes with a price. You will be gravely overworked and vastly underpaid for unloading a truck, compared to the competition. Burlington is a company thinks they can scrape by on paying people basement level pay, somehow thinking that people will stick around because they're desperate for a job. There is virtually no workplace culture. Management will try my best to deny you your breaks in then the name of so-called efficiency. The only positive thing about this company is that my co-workers were mostly nice to me."
Burlington-Stores,1fkc1rhtmt4de801,2,"Good Workplace, But some bad things",Sales Associate,"First off working here is fun\xe2\x80\xa6 when it\xe2\x80\x99s not busy, management is alright, most of the time the managers are sitting in the office not doing anything. The supervisors are the coolest people there, and co-workers are cool as well, one of the few things I like is that supervisors are always there checking up on you, making sure you are okay. But a thing you will hate working here is definitely the lines, the place gets busy in an instant if you don\xe2\x80\x99t keep the line short. Other than that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have much. Place gets stressful here and there though."
Burlington-Stores,1fkc0u2k1t4de802,1,Fun,Cashier,Fun job horrible pay. Work around schedule sometimes. Great job for someone that is young and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of bills. They need to up the pay because no one can live of that salary

Burlington-Stores,1fk35uiqeu3mm801,2,Busy and Exhausting,Cashier/Customer Service,"The worst retail job I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked so far. Yes, retail is a lot, but Burlington is a different kind of bad. Unprofessional, disorganized, just all around stressful! The starting pay of $11/hr is not enough for all that they make you do."
Burlington-Stores,1fk2edttht52e800,3,Solid work for not so solid pay,Receiving Associate,"The work you do is solid enough and keeps you occupied all day. No need to interact with customers since you'll be in the back all day everyday unless you putting product on the floor after its been tagged and such. Management seemed a little oblivious to the fact that we needed more help, and especially for the holiday season."
Burlington-Stores,1fk2dnfj7u3lr800,1,Horrible place to work and the pay doesn’t match the work,Cashier,"Management is the reason most people leave. They will overwork you and it is always understaffed. Management will do nothing but complain the whole time on the walkie-talkie and will \xe2\x80\x9cfind something for you to do\xe2\x80\x9d when you get even the slightest break in the line. This could mean doing other stuff that isn\xe2\x80\x99t on the list of responsibilities for your job title. Overall, bad environment that isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth the stress."
Burlington-Stores,1fk15i52lt54k800,2,Cheap company ,Cashier and Customer Service,No chance for benefits unless your management. Another company that wants you to push high interest rate credit cards and fake donations. Low pay. They make employee events but don't do most of them.
Burlington-Stores,1fk0j15etu53l801,3,Cashier/sales associate ,Cashier/Sales Associate,"Working for this company helped me learning more about costumer service. The hours were ok, the pay was bad but I\xe2\x80\x99m thankful for having the chance to learn .It\xe2\x80\x99s good for a first job.

Burlington-Stores,1fk06ss0ihihn800,4,Not a bad place to work,Associate,"The environment is great and the job is easy, but the pay is low. There are a lot of hours to get throughout the store but they aren\xe2\x80\x99t always guaranteed due to the company not wanting full time associates.  "

Burlington-Stores,1fjvujh95hihn800,1,Minimum Wage is Not Competitive Pay,Cashier/Customer Service,"Jobs are advertised as Competitive Pay which makes no sense since the pay is Minimum Wage. You can't pay less than that! Supervisors are on power trips which is laughable but supported by store management. You are discouraged from using your accumulated sick time if you are ill. If you come to work & store is closed due to power outage, they won't pay you for 3 hours as the state requires. You are held after you punch out / off the clock, to sign forms, hear announcements, other activities you should get paid for. Management takes advantage of employees not knowing their basic rights. Many employees are new to the US or speak limited English. Hours cut periodically so managers can get a better bonus. No concern for the employees losing pay but big concern for managers keeping those bonuses high. "
Burlington-Stores,1fjut4qk6u53l801,1,bad pay for a lot of work ,Linen Associate,They don\xe2\x80\x99t care about the employees at all very careless. The managers were very  unprofessional. The pay was not good and the there were no benefits.
Burlington-Stores,1fjtk5c3qu1t1802,4,Repetitive and busy but easy job,Cashier/Sales Associate,Overall it was a simple job. As a cashier you do the same thing everyday. There were no coupons or discounts so it was a standard procedure of ringing up items and bagging them.

Burlington-Stores,1fjpr64bnu1am800,1,Horrible workplace,Cashier/Customer Service,"Horrible, stressful, underpaid, micromanaged, understaffed. Absolutely do not pay enough for the work. Too much micromanaging, there\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely no room to improve or gain skill when you\xe2\x80\x99re constantly being watched and criticized for every little mistake.  They can\xe2\x80\x99t keep employees, so they\xe2\x80\x99re constantly bringing in new employees that the managers make everyone else train because they\xe2\x80\x99re too busy doing nothing in the back. The management is absolutely horrible. They don\xe2\x80\x99t communicate and don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to stay organized. The only possible pro is that it is consistently busy, so you\xe2\x80\x99ll always have something to do. They just don\xe2\x80\x99t pay enough to tack on everyone else\xe2\x80\x99s unfinished work onto your own. Most of the people are great to work with, but the managers and most of the supervisors are lazy. You get absolutely no recognition or appreciation for the things you do. Only the things you do wrong. There are people who have worked here for years and never get acknowledged. On top of everything, it is retail and people are impatient and rude. The last thing retail workers need is for the actual workplace to be horrible. "
Burlington-Stores,1fjor6guqt4bb802,3,Coworkers are great ,Loss Prevention Associate,"My coworkers are really great so working is fun. It is the fun part of work that I enjoy, having my coworkers around me. Makes the job less hectic. Only con I have is short breaks. Half an hour is more like a 15-minute break but you do get at least one 15 per shift."
Burlington-Stores,1fjop6c6it4b9800,1,"Nice place to shop, but lines are long.",Supervisor/Manager,Don't do it. Store has favorites and will make you feel incompetent and unimportant. There is no training and the expectation is you already know from the videos you watched. Worst place I've ever worked in my life. Run to anywhere but there.
Burlington-Stores,1fjoge591u1am802,2,Typical retail ,Cashier,"Training is poor. Management is poor. There is much responsibility in the store but no one cares if goals are met, if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a temporary job where you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get comfortable, then this may be for you.

Better pay, better managers, and better culture. Only real gripes are with mandated vaccines and paternity leave policies. However HR is more than willing to talk with you about your requests, so that is a plus."
Camden-Property-Trust,1fi0n50hfu1ns802,1,Disappointed in Management ,,Upper management does NOT encourage you to succeed. They would rather hire outside the company instead of promoting within. The pay is well below what should be unless you\xe2\x80\x99re in a group of favorites then you\xe2\x80\x99ll get a pay adjustment after someone leaves the company. Most of the executives here could care less about their employees. 
Camden-Property-Trust,1fhgqk1d2o2id801,2,Should Not be top 100 companies to work for anymore,Customer Relations Advisor,"When I started with Camden the culture and people were great, as the years have gone by the management and support has lessened A LOT.  Management does not care and def has favorites.  "
Camden-Property-Trust,1fh6qlrf0t499801,4,Good place to work,Community Manager,"Good place to work. Stressful at times, but it has a great culture. Great coworkers to help you learn, and grow along the way.Upper management pushes a little too much at times, and forces some of the decisions out of your hands. But overall, it's a solid place to work."
Camden-Property-Trust,1fgicum8ou412801,1,Upper Management is a Joke,Maintenance Supervisor,Upper Management is consistently playing favorites and will make your work life as difficult as possible if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t part of the \xe2\x80\x9cteam\xe2\x80\x9d until you quit or they find any petty reason to let you go.
Camden-Property-Trust,1fec7eu693od8001,4,Experience from the Construction Team: Mostly great w/ some cons,Assistant Superintendent,Overall a great place to work. I feel confident in my superiors at work. The culture is very strong at Camden with multiple events throughout the year on normal years (pre-covid). Work-life balance in construction is very difficult as is. Even more so when you constantly have to deal with poor subcontractors that always seem to get the next job for unexplainable reasons.   
Camden-Property-Trust,1favpsp8au1ea800,4,Good company overall,Leasing Consultant,Good company overall they do a great job of implementing their culture. Incentives are good. Would recommend working at renovated properties as older communities are more challenging. The bare minimum will be put into the upkeeping of units which can be frustrating as an agent and also for residents. Good work/life balance if willing to work weekends. Managers could use some additional ethical training. There are office politics as opportunities for advancement are often presented but hard to obtain. Overall Camden is a great start if new to the industry. Working a lease up community is highly recommended.    
Camden-Property-Trust,1favbmfqft4lp800,5,Great Company Culture,Leasing Agent,Great overall company to work for. They really take the time to make sure their employees are happy and have the tools to be successful. Good benefits too.
Camden-Property-Trust,1f4b1p0fmu39f800,5,"Great Experience, Great Training, Great Co-Workers",Leasing Consultant,"I have been with Camden for 2 years and feel very valued here. They constantly do training sessions (have adapted to virtual), are willing to do one-on-one meeting with upper level management for growth advice, and actually give you great benefits (PTO, sick time, company events, company awards). I wish the commission was a little higher as I've heard other companies offer a bit more, but overall the company is a great place to work with people who you can actually enjoy being around 40 hrs a week. "
Camden-Property-Trust,1f0rmqgh8s7jc800,2,If you like gossip work here,Assistant Manager,"Camden is a great company if you like everyone in your business. They make it a point to make sure every single community is involved with one another. They make sure everyone knows everyone\xe2\x80\x99s personal business. It\xe2\x80\x99s more like high school. Upper management checks in once in a blue but isn\xe2\x80\x99t approachable at all to talk about issues on site. Management bullies employees, purposely excludes people they don\xe2\x80\x99t like, disrespects, and belittles staff if you\xe2\x80\x99re not a favorite. No consistency on rules/ policies. Even if you follow the rules at some point you will be wrong because they \xe2\x80\x9cneed to be flexible\xe2\x80\x9d. Residents ALWAYS get their way even when breaking fair housing laws. My suggestion: don\xe2\x80\x99t bother helping, just push the issue to management.They do offer tuition reimbursement which is good considering they are very clear that they only want people to work for them if they have a degree. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t promote without a bachelor minimum.\xe2\x80\x9d Hourly rate is standard but bonuses are pretty good. "
Camden-Property-Trust,1f0fnqjr5hiq9800,4,"Amazing Culture, but Management Could Improve",Corporate Team Member,"The culture and way that employees are made to feel excited, empowered, and valued is unparalleled but some upper management and VP changes along with natural decrease in opportunities through attrition is worrisome for long-term career growth. "
Camden-Property-Trust,1ekkah7aisa2d800,5,You make what you want out of your job,Groundskeeper/Maintenance,"The time I spent in Camden was great. We were offered great discounts on leases, bonuses would come unexpectedly, I just wish the pay could have been higher for maintenance and groundskeepers. The benefits balanced this out to a degree. You have lots of room to transfer locations if you wish. I will say this company is for team players and those willing to incorporate Camden\xe2\x80\x99s ideologies, otherwise this may not be a fit for you. There were times when I was quite unhappy, but this was related more to not meshing with certain personalities in a work setting, a manager who did not value her employees, and that manager let residents run the property rather than trying to keep rules in place. This can happen at any company. Making a career inside Camden can be beneficial if you go in for the long haul. "
Camden-Property-Trust,1ek4r40oh3o71000,5,People are great,TBD,I enjoyed my time with Camden. People are friendly and helpful. Doors are open and receptive for critique and new ideas and plans. Some free lunches and good environment.
Camden-Property-Trust,1ej3m2pfqu1dj800,4,Good place to work,Contact Center Representative,"CPT really tries to take care of its employees, I think it is a great place to start a career . The only thing I can say is the micromanaging in my department has gotten out of control. "
Camden-Property-Trust,1eir6ru4du1dj800,5,"Customer focused, people driven, team players, results oriented, fun workplace",Community Manager,"I retired after being with this amazing company for 23 years?  Needless to say Camden became my second home. The culture is unmatched, the benefits amazing, Camden truly cares about their employees, team members work together and are always willing to help. More importantly we all know how to have fun!  I consider myself fortunate to have worked with such an amazing group of people at the community, regional and corporate level. "
Camden-Property-Trust,1egk4dn65rg31800,5,Great place to work!,Leasing Consultant,"Every property is different and will have their own characteristics. The managers care about their properties and you will feel like your work matters. The culture is great and employees are celebrated for their hard work. I have worked at 2 different properties and have gotten along well with all of my coworkers. The company gave money out to residents across the US who were struggling due to Covid-19. What company do you know would give away millions?? I feel like I am always learning something new and am staying busy. It can be stressful at times, but it's not always easy when you are working with the public. There is opportunity for advancement and to expand your knowledge. It is not the typical 9-5 Monday-Friday job, and I like that! I enjoy having week days off, and I can work my schedule so that I have 4 day weekends! I highly recommend this company!"
Camden-Property-Trust,1ecs49qhfrgbf800,1,I relocated for this job and left 2 months later,Assistant Property Manager,"I did not have the best experience with Camden Property Trust in Charlotte NC. My first week my team did not want to accept me as the new Assistant Manager. My Manager treated the LC as an Assistant Manager instead of me. My team blamed me for things I did not do 2x and I made sure I had proof. Racism, discrimination and sexism occurs here. Favoritism is common. I don\xe2\x80\x99t recommend."
Camden-Property-Trust,1ecn7h7skrie7800,1,Not fair,Maintenace ,"you cant trust management to care for its employees theres a lot of retaliation that goes on whats the point in going to your district manager if they are not going to have your back?. The pay could be way better, the communication could be better. Also management having favorites with also having  consequences to management for having ""special relationships"" with other employees in the same community. Also managers talking about their employees behind their back all the time."
Camden-Property-Trust,1ebq90bhmp2qv800,3,Amazing leadership in the Houston home office.

Don\xe2\x80\x99t be fooled by that like I was. Salary was low, benefits okay, don\xe2\x80\x99t really care about their employees. When you have a concern, management truly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care. I worked there well over a year and didn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy it at all."

They provide fun team work building classes for the employees every other month, they hold annual events for the employees all over to network, and they reward and acknowledge employees accomplishments. There is a lot of room for growth within the company."
Camden-Property-Trust,1e6krd2ofo1qe800,5,Good company to work for.,Assistant Community Manager,Camden is a good company to work for. They have great benefits and are always contributing back to the community. Culture is awesome. The hardest part of my job at the very end was saying goodbye. It's true that you do not leave a company you leave a boss.
Camden-Property-Trust,1e6dhh9cvoa36800,1,Horrible management on site,Community Maintenance Supervisor,The manager on site is a Khaki pompous you know What   I left and turn my notice in because of the manager at Camden Midtown she is the worst manager I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever worked for in my 30 something years of working in maintenance
Camden-Property-Trust,1e4f3klqgnp37802,4,Great Company!,Competitive Leasing Professional,"Camden truly values and invests in its employees. There is a strong sense of support and rigorous on-boarding/mentoring process that ensures each employee is equipped to perform at their best. There is an annual fun day, annual award ceremony and sense of supportive family throughout the company. \r My reason for 4/5 stars is a favorites game that leadership tends to play. Even if you are entirely qualified, It can be a challenge to move up if you're not favored. Also expect to work most weekends and sometimes 10 days in a row. The burnout can be real and sometimes Camden will order you a pizza to smooth out any ruffled feathers rather than actually hearing out your concerns and addressing them."
Camden-Property-Trust,1e3ashl01hdu9803,4,Okay overall,Maintenance Supervisor,"Good Benefits and good pay. The company is large and did provide room for advancement. Long term career possibilities, but it was time to move on. That's it."

Camden-Property-Trust,1dujl63c2hdak803,4,It is a fun workplace and rewarding,Maintenance Supervisor,"During my 7-8 years working for Camden Property Trust it was great. It was always about the employees first and then customers and THEN investors/stock holders. The first 5 years were amazing and Camden\xe2\x80\x99s culture is fun and very productive. The last 2 years I was there things started changing. It was no longer about the employees anymore, things started to go in the favor of the stock holders/investors which made the employees expendable. People were being \xe2\x80\x9clet go/fired\xe2\x80\x9d eft and right. The last 4 months were the worst. I got a new manager at the property I worked at and she quickly made it noticeable that she was trying to fire me. I tried talking to the regional manager but she had already turned her against me despite the fact that the regional manager would always say good things about me BEFORE that new manager started working there. When the day came that she fired me, i tried to go to HR to provide my proof of being wrongfully fired but HR never returned my callls despite leaving numerous voicemails. I also had a good friend of mine who was a Maintenance Supervisor talk to HROC\xe2\x80\x99s head of the dept to give me a call regarding what had happened. He told my friend he would call me......til this day I have not heard from HR or the director of HROC, its been 4 months now. Overall I would say working for Camden is a great opportunity and it is still one of the best companies to work for in the multi-family business. I hold no grudges, and if given the chance to work for Camden again I would."
Camden-Property-Trust,1ducr0s0q58kr804,2,Leasing Consultant,Leasing Consultant,"Job is good if you like to work every weekend and 7- 10 day stretches before you get a day off. They do not tell you this in the interview. Managers only work one Saturday out of the month so expect to be there in their absence. When it comes to incentives make sure all of your paperwork is in order. If not, Camden will not pay you for your lease even though they are still making money from the move-in. Leasing consultants are overworked and underpaid"
Camden-Property-Trust,1dubj8ua8nouj802,4,Good place to work with great culture,Assistant Manager,"Camden Property Trust is a great place to work and their culture is one of the best in the industry. \rAdvancement opportunities can be limited because of few positions to choose from, and frequent hiring of external candidates, but if you work hard you will eventually be recognized. \rThe upper management team is very personable and keeps things light and fun. \rThe resources Camden provides to its employees really makes them the best around."

I was a temp to hire with plenty of experience. Though the first feeling I had from the rest of the maintenance crew was they didn't seem to like me. You can't move forward from being envious that goes for Leo. Again the job is easy just maintenance needs to be more respectful for new team members don't be envious
Camden-Property-Trust,1dpaqr1fo52te800,5,Innovative and positive environment,Assistant Manager,CPT is a leading company in the property management world for good reason: they are committed to excellence with their employees and those choosing to call them home.

It's a company driven by their cultural guidelines.

After 180 days, you start accruing unlawful presence and you do not want to get to this point - you start to face future bans to the U.S. Most lawyers will recommend leaving well before that - it is not worth the risk to jeopardize the ability to come back.\r With that said, it can be worth the $100-$150 to discuss your individual circumstances with an attorney, especially if you are trying to buy extra time to wrap up affairs/very close to securing a new job. Please do talk to an attorney to confirm that it\xe2\x80\x99s still 60 days - it was current as of recently, but this timeline does shift from time to time.

However, I have seen many people leave the company because they have been passed over for promotions when they were qualified for the position. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen an increase in external hires over promoting your own people when Camden is always talking about building the bench.\r It\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate because it has the potential to be a great job but a lack of positive feedback for a job well done is demotivating and discouraging.\r They do things that seem to only be for photo ops but lack any real substance.

I have been with Camden for over 10 years and hope to be around for another decade. Employees are supported in both their personal and professional goals. Salaries and benefits are competitive, and our employee vacation units have come in handy for several family vacations.\r With a relatively small company and low turnover, it can take longer to move up. However, Camden makes sure that all employees can develop within their roles and position themselves for promotions when they are available; there is no wasted time here, only time spent learning and growing."

Camden-Property-Trust,1cq6boislakhn800,4,Liked this as a first job out of college,Leasing Consultant,"Did not want to grow in this company as I was interested in working in a different industry, so I am not the best person to review the company. When I worked here, I did like the culture."
Camden-Property-Trust,1cosfq7qhak65800,1,Terrible management,Customer Service,"I worked at the Camden property trust for a year and it was like being in high school all over again. The older women click up and talk about each other. It was very uncomfortable. I even saw one of the ladies lie on a contract employee and got him fired! I saw the incident in question and when I tried to go to the management they told me it was already taken care of. Management out sources as much work as possible. When you first work there you think it\xe2\x80\x99s too good to be true, because everyone seems extra friendly, and it is! People are willing to trample you to get to the top! Horrible!"

Unfortunately I didn't have the best experience at Camden . I absolutely loved my job but my manager always found a way to shift the positive energy of all the employees.
Camden-Property-Trust,1ck9jh7in1fdp1iq,5,The best company I have ever worked for,Assistant Manager,The company has made it to the fortune 500 many years in a row. The company invest in their staff with monthly and yearly classes.  They show their appreciation by closing all offices for a day to have an all expense paid employee day. Once a year we close the office for a company Christmas party and also a company awards party.The best part of the job is making life long friends with coworkers and upper management.
Camden-Property-Trust,1ck9c5mis1ahb2nn,1,Camden Sucks,Accounts Payable,"Camden was a good place to work for at the beginning,  but the company has declined. A lot of family members work for the company and they feel they can do whatever they want to do up there.  When you have an issue with management, you do not have any support.  Anyone who wants to work at Camden, do not work anywhere in the accounting department because you will regret it.  Management is horrible.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
Camden-Property-Trust,1ck03l9k91agn7pb,5,Good company to work for,Multi-Property Service Manager,"Good company to work for.  I worked there for 8 years and enjoyed my time with them but had to leave the area for personal reasons, and they did not have any locations in that area to transfer to."
Camden-Property-Trust,1cjpc9njp0mcm6h8,4,Good Stable Company to Work For,MAINTENANCE SUPERVISOR,We had a budget however when it came to customer service they were very Pro Customer/Pro Resident.   If I went over budget all I had to do would give an explanantion.   Never had to rob peter to pay paul on any replacement parts for other apartments.
Camden-Property-Trust,1cja1q7cmb85ccj8,5,Used to be an awesome place to work.... Going down hill,Maintenance Supervisor,When I started at Camden it was great. The past few years they have sort of lost their way. Too many processes. So many meetings and new peocesses make it difficult to atay focused and gwt your work done.
Camden-Property-Trust,1ci4vvsn7akgmbf7,4,Good company,Property Manager,Good company. Began to move towards what competitors were doing versus remaining different and unique. Compensation is not on level with industry. Good benefits.
Camden-Property-Trust,1chokfg3kb84qej1,4,Resdidential Tech,Resident Technician,Being Multi talented is the only way to explain it. You had to all kinds of repairs in apartment and get them rent ready after move outs take care of swimming pools do AC repairs and other work orders for residents. Fast paced and always keeping the property clean and appealing as well as the apartments.
Camden-Property-Trust,1chm6gfkd5ncm8u8,5,Great company overall,Community Manager,My experience within Camden was a bittersweet one.  I really love the company and what it represents but one person's agenda really change my experience from one of growth and opportunity into a one way trip to nowhere.  I loved most of my coworkers and peers but had one manager that did not want to see past their own aspirations to get what they wanted.  It was a difficult separation but I wouldn't trade a single minute of my experience there.
Camden-Property-Trust,1chf3u4p4ak8j94o,5,Great environment,Contact Center Consultant,Amazing place to work. The people and the sense of family make it very fun. The people at the top know what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing and it shows. Management constantly shows their appreciation.

Camden-Property-Trust,1cctsbduk5nd0b0c,4,Company Culture is fantastic!,Leasing Consultant,"Fast-paced, field phones/emails, excellent training (Camden U), low hourly pay, commission caps at $125, inconsistent disciplinary enforcement by management... Typical politics, but overall great company and fun experience. Company Culture is everything! Advancement is all about knowing the right people and scratching the right backs, less about competency."
Camden-Property-Trust,1cc01njouak4p9bo,4,Fun productive company,Leasing/Asst,It was a fast paced environment which was nice. My favorite thing about Camden was they always thrive on training.

Camden-Property-Trust,1cat5sh49ak8jes9,4,Camden Property Trust Review,Leasing Consultant,Camden overall is a great company. It really just depends on which location you work at and what position you're in. Does have advancement opportunities BUT is very limited.
Camden-Property-Trust,1c9n5r37dakfsc45,5,Great Place to work!,Leasing Manager / Assistant Manager,"Great Place to work! Maintain accurate resident records. Updated on daily basis all rents, deposits and application fees received from residents. Issued appropriate notice when necessary (e.g., late payments, eviction notices, returned check memos)."
Camden-Property-Trust,1c9l6ltkgakjpbt7,3,Good pay with little advancement.,Leasing Consultant,Camden  was a great company to work for until on-site incidences kept occurring & upper management cared more about performance than their employees well being & safety. The property I worked for was understaffed majority of the time I was there. Also I seen a culture of favoritism in advancement to a certain gender & class rather than expertise & tenure. People who worked for the company for almost ten years were leaving the company due to this. \r The positives included the pay and work life balance. Also the healthcare was amazing. They celebrated accomplishments & offered bonus incentives for performance. Meeting prospects & turning them into residents was also rewarding.
Camden-Property-Trust,1c8h6ga2ubrft9ln,5,Loved working here,Analyst,"Camden was a great place to work. Management was very humble and communicative. The environment is collaborative and fun and full of incredibly smart and thoughtful people. My only complaint was that I felt a bit underpaid compared to my peers at other companies; however, I loved working here and thought that the work/life balance was great."

Camden-Property-Trust,1c5q11d5jake6fuq,4,,Maintenance Tech,"Camden really knew how to fairly treat their employees. Some positions could have paid a bit better, but the overall schedule for the maintenance tech position was nice. The drawback was being on-call, but that was in the requirements. Christmas bonuses were nice even if you didn't have a lot of seniority. I learned a lot from working there. A lot of skills that help in owning a home and skills that have helped down the road."
Camden-Property-Trust,1c2cvjgriakcsf3i,3,Could be a great Company,Accounts Payable Representative,This is mostly a family oriented company.  No room for advancement unless you are a certain class of people.  The management is horrible and not fair.

Although they have many properties, it feel like one big team when you meet others from other properties. There is a lot of support within the company. They listen and implement ideas from lower level staff. Camden cares and gives back to the community through community service projects nation wide. I love making residents happy even though at times things happen out of our control. The hardest part of my job with Camden is leaving at the end of the day. I just don't want to stop working and improving the lives of others!!"

Valued, appreciated, and growth is just a tip of what Camden provides.  The company is strong in their knowledge and has grown me to higher levels that I have never imagined.  Just as I think I have grasped my role, I am challenged again with growth in knowledge.  I have been with Camden for nearly a year, and I can honestly say I learn something new everyday.

Camden-Property-Trust,1b7vatk7r5ne2fgk,2,Company lost its vision,Lead technician,I was with this company almost 10 years. The first 5 years were great. The last 5 were a gut twisting nightmare. Changes in middle management at the district level was a complete morale killer.  It was like being in high school again. If you enjoyed going home to your family instead of going out drinking and schmoozing with management there was absolutely no room for growth.  I was at this company ten years and I applied for promotions three times. I wasn't even interviewed. The employee turn over rate was so high at the end that at company functions no one hardly knew any one else. Did it ever occur to anyone in management to wonder why?
Camden-Property-Trust,1b7qms35r1ahi0b2,5,Growth and development opportunities with an amazing culture...,Community Manager,"I have worked with for Camden for several years and was able to grow rapidly within the company.

The owners were great, down to earth, actually got to know those of us working for them. their relationships were always being worked on. I did not actually love cleaning but they made it worth it. They always made me feel like I was important and that they respected the job I did even though I was part time and cleaned for them. My co-workers were the best. They felt more like family. I still talk to them on a regular basis. Hardest part of the job was the actual cleaning of some of the more gross apartments. It was physically challenging to keep up with when we had the high turns of the college students all at once. I liked the people the best, and did like the end result of a completely clean apartment after I spent so much time and effort to get it finished. I learned that I can clean almost anything, that I can enjoy helping people during the trying time of moving into a  new place."

Pretty repetitive but at the same time something new was happening new every day. Over my 2+ years there I learned a great deal on customer service and the importance of teamwork. Camden provided great training and ongoing learning to help with on the job tasks. Career advancement opportunities were limited in the region I was located leading to my departure. \r     I really enjoyed my coworkers. Camden did a great job of hiring people into a good environment.The toughest thing about the job was dealing with factors that were out of my hands. A constant fluctuation in price changed demand so drastically that it was hard to keep a constant flow of customers coming in. Overall a pretty good company with decent benefits but just didn't lead anywhere for me. Great learning experience and stepping stone to advance my career elsewhere.

Camden-Property-Trust,19sjqfrt1ak62d45,2,middle management change is necessary,Property Management,I have experienced both ends of the spectrum from completely satisfied and joyful to completely disappointed and discouraged.\r Leasing consultants have no voice and can easily be eliminated without due process.  Anything can be reported to mid management and HR without the employee even so much as being given the right to speak on their own behalf. \r Disgusts me.

Camden-Property-Trust,19r8u2v40akb384g,3,Good place to start if you have no experience in the corporate world,Leasing Consultant,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that I was out a lot showing apartments- you are not inside of the office all day long. I got out a lot which is great in my opinion- I never liked being glued to an office chair.\r The compensation used to be better, now the commission is getting lower and lower. Keep in mind you will be required to work during the weekends as well. The co workers were ok; the worst part of the job was dealing with the residents/prospects. Some residents are rude and have no manners (to the point at yelling at people in the office). I worked in three different locations."

They hold themselves to higher standards than most multi family companys and it shows in the customer and employee satisfaction.  My typical work day consists of answering numerous calls about our community and pricing.  I then hope to set apointment in order to give the prospective resident a tour of our fantastic amenities, tell them all about our community and show them their desired apartment.  When they lease i help them through that process to get them one step closer to moving in, which also consist of provided paperwork, statements and helping set up utilities.  Once they are resident I assist in day to day needs like scheduling service repairs, transfering, renewing and eventualy their exit process, all while trying to build better relationships and keep our customers happy."

Camden-Property-Trust,17v7jh8h4adsgfop,3,Disheartening change in a great company.,Business Manager,"Camden has been an incredible company in the past and will be again if...the principles of the company stop and look at the big picture. \rIn an effort to grow their business they employed self-centered, selfish, and self-serving people. Grant it they hid it very well in the beginning... their true colors didn\'t start shining through for a while, but enough has happened that the principles have surely noticed. \rEmployee turnover is through the roof, especially long term people.  Change is certain in a large company like Camden but when the basic foundation is lost in translation...meaning remember and value the people that helped put the company where it is... the tower starts to crumble.\r Although the principles verbalize that they appreciate and care about each and every person they employ...the buck stops there. From the CEO down, the people in charge of the Houston market are all about themselves, and how to get their friends at the top of the food chain. They have systematically eliminated anyone they feel doesn\'t fit their idea of a ""leader"" in other words...don\'t question, disagree or argue. Do what you\xe2\x80\x99re told, and if it\xe2\x80\x99s not right too bad...take the blame. Camden use to allow for individual thinking and encouraged discussions, opinions and suggestions, to some degree they still do but no one dares verbalize it or they might find themselves being escorted out of the building soon after. \rMany long term, loyal, and committed folks have lost their jobs because of the selfish and jealous motives the ""in charge"" people foster. These people need to be phased out. They"

I learned so many things (personal and professional) working for this company.  There is absolutely nothing negative or politically correct I have to say...just an overall great company to work for. If I did not relocate to a city that did not have a Camden property I would still be employed with them.

I also am the leasing manager so I oversee 5-8 staff members daily. I have been with the company for many years and have learned so many values that make me a big asset to my future endeavors. I have been lucky enough to work with the same manager for all my years. There is a lot of room for promotion within this company so my team has changed many times throughout the years. I would say my biggest struggles have been dealing with difficult customers and having to over come the many road blocks we tend to run into in this line of work. Every single day at work is fun and my favorite part would be being able to assist our customers in finding their new home and starting the future with Camden."

Try to aim at working at a property with high rents because you will love your commission check. All in all, the money was good and the bonuses were awesome. The only negative about Camden is that your experience with this company depends upon your community manager. Most managers are not held accountable for their unprofessionalism and being that this is a female demoninated field, many managers can be petty and full of gossip and drama. I definitely recommend keeping your business to yourself and staying out of the office drama and your work experience will be just fine!"
Camden-Property-Trust,17k92bfm7ae0g914,5,Camden is rated in the Top 100 Places to Work,Community Manager,Very fast pace community and very diverse. Camden was great to work for allowing me to do my job as well as providing me with all the tools and training needed to exceed expectations. They actually listen and ask for feedback from their employees. I hired a great team that worked closed together to meet the goals of the property. The hardest part of this job was having to file eviction on residents that could not continue to pay rent for one reason or another. I loved the fast pace environment and the diversity of the job.

Camden-Property-Trust,17hd0e7ti5dogcnd,2,Dead-end job,Leasing Consultant,"A typical day involves being extremely under paid for the extremely over worked responsibilities that Camden requires of you. Every day you are not a share holder, you are harassed why you are not buying company stock. The same goes if you don\'t have insurance or 401K or anything else that allows Camden to keep your money away from you. Speaking of which, they require you to get uniforms. The first batch is $700 and you are now in debt to them for then next 12 months for this amount; every 6 months, you are given a $250 replenishment that you are in debt for the next 12 months. These are *not* ""FREE"" uniforms. You do not earn vacation for the first 6 months-- please do not confuse this is not just that you can\'t USE vacation, because you don\'t even EARN vacation for 6 months. Then you are given the full year\'s balance up front to use, which you are now in debt to Camden for. If you don\'t use the vacation, you lose the vacation. So almost every one of Camden\'s policies are set up for you to be in debt with them. If you want to leave, even voluntarily, you will NOT get a final pay check-- they take it away from you."

I work at the jrc location & the environment was different from what i was use to. Everyone was pretty cool most supervisors were helpful and the co workers was cool as also. When everything happened with COVID they were quick to respond. When things were in the media about BLM they were quick to respond in a positive understanding way. Love it.

Capital-One,1fkq3k0v6ocrn800,3,Management is the main issue working here,Estates Coordinator,"We were told in training that it\'s not about what you know it\'s about who you know in order to move up in the company. We thought the trainer\'s were joking until we actually started working ""on the floor"" (as they call it). There is literally no opportunity to move up based on work ethic and work history alone, you have to basically kiss butt and become close to a higher up in a different department to be considered for a position you applied for inside the company. They want to know someone who knows you personally within the company vs providing promotion based on your work credentials within the company. Work life balance is non existent, Breaks are short, management makes the environment feel tense. Most of new management in the department don\'t care about you or the ""team"" in general, they are only their to get more inside experience to add to their work resume then they leave shortly after. They can take 6+ months before reviewing your application even if they state that they are ""urgently hiring"".  They ask opinions on how they can be better As company and how they can improve your working experience with them but none of the suggestions are ever implemented. The pay is not sufficient enough for the work load. "

The posting for the job was vague and was explained as one thing but once we started training the position is very robust and the calls are on some of everything. It is a challenging job to get acclimated to. The pay is not that great considering the cost of living is constantly rising and you are not able to negotiate. When you experience you want to be paid a little more especially when there is not much flexibility in the schedules and you sometimes have to work holidays. They think being receiving holiday pay is a bonus but coming from companies where you are paid and able to be off it really is not.

One thing that I did not like was their newly integrated proprietary system Empath is riddled with system issues, making it harder to perform an already hectic job role. Outsourced positions is another thing that made the job difficult.

The customers were great and so was management and team members. Best part I liked was not being micromanaged or being forced to watch my time on a call. They cared more about the customers than worrying about how much time we were spending on each call. My overall experience I would rate it a 5 being a really great company to work for. 
Capital-One,1fjjh1drhu1t1800,4,overall a good place to work,Unit Manager,Capital One has a positive work environment.  They go above and  beyond to care for the front line associates however front line management doesn\xe2\x80\x99t receive the same care.  Once you are in management you are expected to outperform your peers.  You can\xe2\x80\x99t be satisfied with your position and would be expected to move up the ladder.  They use a forced ranking to evaluate their employees making it very competitive.  \xe2\x80\x9cCompanies get filled with medium performers.  They are the most dangerous.  They can add value but they can not take you to the next level.\xe2\x80\x9d - Rich Fairbanks
Capital-One,1fjh9531at4bb802,3,The culture is amazing... if you aren't a customer facing employee,SCRA Coordinator,"to start, the pay and benefits are top notch. The first issue is how different the culture is between the customer interacting agents and those that do not. As you would expect, they are mostly sequestered on two separate sites with little overlap. The amenities are worlds apart in terms of both quantity and quality. Phone agents have to carefully schedule personal development time around business needs. Whole DEPARTMENTS took a half day to hear a celebrity speaker when they came to the other campus. Managers on the customer facing side or being hired from outside of the company.  Some are promoted from within, and those are the best. Those from outside the company have never been in our seat and truly have no idea how to use our systems or handle our customers. Their main purpose is to hold people accountable to the metrics. This leads to the other issue. Instead of taking people to task for their repeated deficiencies, they start making entire department wide changes to try and make people fall in line. This dented the morale of those workers that were hitting metrics already and just added another layer of stress to an already frazzled employee base. Customers were not immune to this either. after the start of the pandemic, like most businesses, there was some belt tightening and the customers felt it. They called in A LOT. The go to answer as to why our carefully cultivated customers  were no longer getting all of the perks they had come to expect (and were irate about losing).... ""It is a business decision and they are welcome to check back at anytime to see if anything"

I personally am not a sedentary person and it was hard. Keeping up with the metric system they have is hard. I dont know why they just don't do away with the system.

Capital-One,1fiaabgdln52s801,3,It can get very stressful,Specialty funder,"It was ok, it just gets very stressful. You are expected to meet minimum requirements even if the work volume is almost non existent.

Capital-One,1fi8l38k2u1sk802,5,7years in and covid 19 made me leave. Would go nack,Branch Ambassador,Things are different now. When I started in 2012 I walked right in and introduced myself to a branch manager who took my information and asked me to fill out an online app. Two days later I got a call to schedule and interview. The interview was fun and exciting. Today however it's all virtual. Goodluck. Great place to work if you are smart and reliable. If you are not ready to be ontime or use digital tools don't apply. A perk is starting with 4 weeks pto on day 1 and a nice hourly wage. I started at 10.50 but it's up to 18 I believe. Oh also a machine counts out the money. You only count out to the client once these days instead of the three count method. 
Capital-One,1fi3gar7jt51r802,3,Great benefits ,Brand Ambassador,Great benefits but associates are overworked with no work life balance. Management is horrible!!! Expect Ambassador role is such a joke and they stress you out behind audit. 
Capital-One,1fi2otpubsa0n800,4,I learned a lot ,Fraud Investigator,Cap One is about business. They hire you to work and not play around. If your lucky to be hired you must take your job seriously and put the means of the business first. Working for Cap One I learned about being hired in the fraud department. There training is extensive and necessary so you can do your job the best of your ability. I worked here for a long time the work environment was a little toxic due to the type of individual that were hired after awhile recruiting got lazy. But the job itself was very cool I enjoyed my daily task and combating fraud. 
Capital-One,1fi2cla19u1sk800,1,Terrible ,Teller,"Not enough people worked there therefore a lot of work usually landed on one person which made the job a bit difficult. There was no security, I was actually robbed at gunpoint while expecting my first child. "

Capital-One,1fhe2e6gin518800,2,okay place to work,Customer Service Representative,"pretty good, pay is good, if you dont do your job 100% perfectly you will be fired ASAP.

Capital-One,1fh9soo0ts9uh800,5,Pretty good for a call center,Customer Service Representative,"It's a call center job but you get to work from home during covid. 9 out of 10 customers are at least decent and if you can manage to not let that one jerk bother you, it's ok. Alotnof diff systems and strict policies and regulations since it's a bank."
Capital-One,1fh7f1446s9uh800,3,Good benefits horrible for advancement ,Fraud Specialist,I have been trying to advance my career and have been stuck in the same department for 3 1/2 years. The expectations of the department is unrealistic considering the amount they pay. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to move up with credentials from other banking institutions doing the same job I have applied for. They promote who they want to regardless of experience or education requirements. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend this company if you just want to come to work and do your job. You have to kiss up to move ahead. 
Capital-One,1fgup7189u2l5800,4,Fun workplace and great benefits.,Brand Ambassador,Worked for Capital One for 7 years and it was amazing.

I was in the hospital a few times due to chronic illness.  Was let go in a very shady way. Not appreciating of temp workers. Management is friendly as long as you suck up to them. 
Capital-One,1fgnmnkoen59l801,4,Fun place to work but hard to keep growing,Process Coordinator,I thought I would hate working at a call center but it was much easier than any other job I had ever had. They keep paying me more and more while I did way less that I used to at my old job.  The culture is great very fun lots of engagement. The only issue is advancement. They moved to a hybrid model but not   the Tampa site and there are only handful of tampa job posting but a huge amount of jobs at other sites like richmond. 
Capital-One,1fgkvg6hus7ho802,4,Overall good place to work for.,Sr. Recovery Associate,"Place for growth, Great training, great workplace, and teamwork. Loved my workplace family. Very big on Vonlunterting and giving back. Very diverse company and very inclusive."

Capital-One,1fg5ceb2qo15m800,1,Abusive customers and poor management ,Senior Account Manager,Underpaid in role. Lack of growth and advancement opportunities. Poor management. Abusive customers. Non stop back to back calls. Companies leave of absence department does everything in their power not to pay you for medically necessary leave. 
Capital-One,1fg2tm3m63kji000,4,Environment was great but poor leadership decisions ,Senior Investment Accountant,Overall Capital One was very open to expanding diversity in all aspects. They also allowed those with a high school diploma establish a career most places require degrees for. The pay was lower compared to similar roles with other organizations but the campus offered a lot of amenities most organizations did not offer. Some of the leaders were not the best. Mostly due to inexperience in the field or unwilling to allow their direct reports to advance. 
Capital-One,1fg2jic49sa1l802,2,Not Great,Branch Ambassador,"I worked for Capital One at the retail level. As a Branch Ambassador, I was the frontline to the bank in all regards. Aside from being overworked, understaffed, and no room for internal mobility or growth in the company, dealing with nasty customers all day was the cherry on top."

"
Capital-One,1ffmhut01o292800,3,Great company,Customer Service Representative,Love the company and I love the benefits and management is amazing and very supportive. The only issue is the pay is low and hard to support family on it. 
Capital-One,1ffmf3ilkhie4802,5,Training can be a bit deceiving..,Customer Experience Coordinator,"Training was quite different compared to the real day to day work life. Meetings and morale building were prominent during training, yet are completely missing when in the position itself. Can be a bit discouraging/lonely especially in the remote setting. Good pay, great benefits, caring company, but not a good fit for many. Essentially a call center job at home. Customers can be extremely rude and are often upset when calling in. Can be very draining and unfulfilling."
Capital-One,1fflr9omr3kji002,5,Capital One,Sr. Fraud Analyst,Great job! Capital One offers a lot of education  for growth and development. I would recommend this company if you are trying to advance your career in the financial industry 
Capital-One,1ffjohquesa1l802,2,Campus in Richmond has nice amenities but management doesn't care as much as they used to,Senior Data Analyst,"The company I worked for was bought by Capital One and everyone I worked with was scared that the merger would mean we would lose our jobs but Capital One management was very nice and welcoming, for the first 2 years.  I realized later that they did that only until they were able to convert the data from the old company system over to theirs then they started to be less accommodating to the older workers and were constantly hiring college grads.  The reviews got more stringent and more demands were made.  The culture at first was very pro work life balance where I found I was the only one working later than 6pm but during my last year many people were working later to keep up with demands or to keep up with the competition.I used to enjoy the team atmosphere but later found I dreaded team meetings and had to watch what I said to who because if I asked for help from a teammate it was seen as a negative - not being autonomous, instead of resourceful.  "
Capital-One,1ffh3uoup3kji000,5,Innovative work place,Executive Assistant,I truly enjoy everything about working for a Capital  One. Upper management truly  takes care of their people especially during the  unprecedented  times that we are in now. 
Capital-One,1ffe2hbaut4pl800,5,"Very flexible, good work-life balance.",Coordinator,A good place to work generally.  There are good perks with working at Capital One.  Workplace culture is very good.  Management is generally pretty good also with good feedback. 
Capital-One,1ffbjpddqu33u800,1,Work Environment ,Associate,"Toxic environment and lack of opportunities for growth.  In order to progress, need to lateral out.  Employees who have been at the company for 10-20 years are being forced out.  Scared of work stability for the future. "
Capital-One,1ffbis4ctt4ep802,1,Uncaring management,Customer Care Coordinator,I don\xe2\x80\x99t recommend working for Capital One. By far this is the worst company I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever worked for. The managers don\xe2\x80\x99t care if you have a health issue or personal issues outside of work. They only care about the business and see you as a number.
Capital-One,1ffb4sl6pu33u802,3,I used to love working here ,Senior Customer Service Representative,"I worked for capital one for two years, when I worked at the site it was amazing, fun, and easy going. I really loved going to work. Then we started WFH and everything hit the fan. call volume skyrocketed people quit and no one was rehired. Very easy to mess up here as well. Rules change without notice. No time to breathe between calls and callers are extremely abusive. Management was very out of touch with how our jobs actually worked and didn\xe2\x80\x99t offer much support. PTO was nice and so was flex time but this job leaves you in tears most days. "
Capital-One,1ff89jk5ju3a4801,5,Working the the management and co workers,Customer Care Representative,I love working at Capital One! I wish an opening will come up so I can apply! Great company to work for. The employees and management was so supportive

Capital-One,1feslsb7vu3a4801,5,Capital one,Customer Service Representative,Depending on what you do at capital one depends on your experience. I was In the auto finance side so I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak on the banking or credit card aspect. But I loved auto finance. I loved coming to work that was in the office. Working from home is a whole different story by now I was in repossession department. It was awful. Trying to juggle a home/work life at the same time in your living room was not for me. Once the world goes back to normal if It goes back. I\xe2\x80\x99ll apply again. The benefits are great. Pto is great. Self-care days are great. 
Capital-One,1fep3qhq7o221801,5,They do alot for employees ,Senior Customer Advocate,Great culture and people. I just did not care for the job I was in. People (customers) can be ugly when they don\xe2\x80\x99t get what they want. You can learn alot about credit cards if your new to the business
Capital-One,1feh66qsvu3a4802,4,Wonderful Diversity & Inclusion program,Coordinator,Very stressful most days.  Management seems concerned with meeting metrics and productivity numbers.  The culture is great - very inclusive.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to work from home.

Capital-One,1fe7t1hf6t4dh802,3,Training waste of time,FRAUD IDENTITY SPECIALIST,"Interview process was excellent. Training process a different story. Spent six weeks learning banking regulations and very little about applications, processes and actual responsibilities of job I was hired to do. You basically have to learn as you go while trying to sound like you know what youre doing while you speak with customers. Training was total waste of time. Three months in and over half my training class already left."
Capital-One,1fe4fekdfu38h802,1,Depends on manager,Customer Service,How much you like this job depends on if you are lucky to get a good manager. It was stressful and customers are rude. Political views and conversation are absolutely not allowed unless you are left leaning.  I miss the benefits though. 
Capital-One,1fe2f6cvm3od8002,2,Its a good place for a college student who wants benefits like tuition reimbursement but if you have a degree then go the opposite way.,Customer Solutions Specialist,"The company itself is fine, benefits are decent, pay is okay, but the HR is simply terrible and would not even listen to your opinion and shove their ultimate decisions down your throat. Upper management is also very toxic and would pressure you for numbers rather than quality. If you are a college student who doesn't have a degree yet and are looking for jobs that offer benefits like the tuition reimbursement then its fine but otherwise go the opposite way."
Capital-One,1fdvk148b3od8000,5,Great team,Teller,Working with a great team that teaches you and helps you learn. Money can be very intimidating but if you\xe2\x80\x99re great with numbers this will be a piece of cake. They were very flexible with changing my schedule from PT to FT. 
Capital-One,1fdtfop7i3od8002,2,Stultifying Reptition,Customer Service Representative,"Customer service for online-only banking consists largely of telling customers you can't take certain actions on their accounts over the phone. Shockingly high volume of individuals (of all economic strata) who sign up for service without understanding what the accounts can/can't do. Difficult to feel satisfaction for job that requires you to speak to adults like children. Management was probably more helpful than your average call center, but that's not worth much to your mental health."
Capital-One,1fdroept43od8002,4,Stressful environment ,Brand Ambassador,Stressful environment but great benefits closed a lot of branches so your dealing with upset and irate customers most of the time but the manager is really good at stepping in to help

Capital-One,1fdq57ergt4d3801,5,"Great culture, with the uncertainty of the future of brick and mortar.",Market Manager ,"Capital One overall is a great company  to work for.

The corporate culture encourages employees to play against each other with ""skip levels"" and ""pull ups"". And worst of all leadership (which is mostly caucasion) pushes liberal progressive agendas so much that it seems that they are trying to prove to themselves that they believe what they say. While Diversity is forced on everyone,  they should really be more in touch with how line level workers are treated."

You are constantly busy, once you end a call another one comes in. It is never slow, no matter what time you work. They try and compensate how much you work with competitions and team outings. I hated this job so much, good people, but it's so stressful that it's not worth it."
Capital-One,1fbihj3tks9sr802,5,Teamwork,Senior Software Engineer,"Good company, great pay. I find the work to be mostly interesting, there are some more dull parts of the company but the pay and campuses keep me around. "
Capital-One,1fbi161m1t4ui802,3,Average,Branch Ambassador,"In the beginning of my journey, my first year working within the company was excellent. They downsized quite a bit & therefore lacked management which made it easy to work on your own and feel empowered learning the ropes without having someone micro manage you. After the first year I realized with new management, the rules & regulations became inconsistent, changing almost everyday. No one really had a sense of what was actually happening, and new additions to the team caused friction as 1 manager often had to manage 2-3 branches and in doing so relied on others to ""observe"" (snitch) on anything & everything they found was not fit whether or not accurate. This caused a drift in the solidity of the team we created and therefore we lost a good amount of solid team members due to the newfound stress."
Capital-One,1fbh7ndlhs9sr800,2,"Plenty of resources and perks for employees, turnover at the management level was high",IAM Engineer L2,"Capital One as a company provides a lot of resources for its employees. Unfortunately my experience wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the best experienced high turnover at the management level. Our team specifically got rotated through 3 managers/ and 2 senior managers and all within the first year of employment. Our niche team was in this holding pattern where they really didn\xe2\x80\x99t know whether  to promote us to level 2, or downgrade us to level 1. And with the constant transitioning through managers, for employee reviews each had its own set of focuses & standards of which they thought was important. For instance one mgr would be big on personal improvement projects, while another manager could care less about a projects and focused heavily on your performance of daily task. So imagine having 1 on 1\xe2\x80\x99s throughout the year discussing your projects, or extra curricular plans of professional growth and your new manager caring less and giving new goals of what they think you should be working on. And then it happening again and receiving another set of goals and expectations\xe2\x80\xa6 it was one of the best companies to be apart of my team was pretty cool and knowledgeable, but career wise I don\xe2\x80\x99t have fond memories due to lack of leadership."

Work life is flexible if you schedule and use your vacation time (at least for all of the 6 different areas I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked in over the years.) As many others mention, the annual review process is garbage. Completely controlled by how well your manager represents you. Some years I work my best and get a middle rating. Other years I\xe2\x80\x99ve coasted and received above average review. "

Capital-One,1fb1vjq8ps7hj801,3,Hectic and fast paced,Relationship Manager,Corporate culture is great.  They offer a lot of resources for education and different career paths.  The downside is the constant turnover due to a fast paced sales environment where individual production must be met as well as producing for vacancies and people out of the office.
Capital-One,1favtae6dt4lp802,3,Nice place to work if you don't mind working in a call center,Customer Service Representative,"If you enjoy working in a call center environment, then this is an excellent job. I did not like working the phones and listening to customers complain about things I have no control over -- so for me, the job was draining and I hated it. However, it is a great company to work for. They offer great benefits, relaxed dressed code, great people and fun activities. Those were the things that made the job bearable during my short time there. I worked the 4x10 schedule -- work 4 days a week for 10 hours with 3 days off. "
Capital-One,1favqqjpoo25r801,5,Great place to work,Legal Specialist Associate,"I worked at Capital One for over 5 years, and I really liked what I did. A typical day was 8:30-5:30, but the culture was great. I worked in the NYC office, and the work life balance was great compared to most companies in the city. I was given support by every manager I ever had, and management goes through extensive training. I think this is how this company avoids toxic management culture. The most enjoyable part of my job was the fact I had the flexibility and support I needed to actually help customers, and that is a very rewarding feeling. Capital One has great benefits, and is overall a great place to work. My only complaints are that I was greatly underpaid and unable to move up easily. In order to grow in most roles, it is beneficial if not critical, to be based in the Richmond offices. Most promotions occur there, and visibility by management is key to moving up. I saw many associates, with less experience and education get promoted before me due to their location. Additionally, I felt I was underpaid for my experience and education. This is the key reason I left.  "

Interviewed with 4 different people and had to do an informal presentation at the beginning and formal one at the end. Whole process was about 4 hours. But after accepting the offer everything I interviewed on was a snapshot of the job itself. Great company culture, really great benefits, supportive management, clear expectations, and decent opportunity for income.

I am a product of downsizing or rightsizing.  In saying that, I would change my opinion of Capital One.  I thoroughly enjoyed my job daily and I worked with the best associates in the company.  Most importantly, we were took care of the customers assigned to our team.  Capital One's reputation was never in question or as risk.  The culture of our team mimic the culture of the company.

In general I\xe2\x80\x99ve found that leadership is lacking tremendously (lots of swirl, no clear goals, etc.) and reorgs happen way too often. One thing to note, culture definitely varies by line of business and team. The Card org is awful. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend to anyone I care about. Bank is much better in my opinion... but again, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure this will largely depend on your team. One other thing to note, I don\xe2\x80\x99t find diversity and inclusion to be as much of a focus as you might think from all of the PR on LinkedIn, lol. Lots of talk, little/no action. VERY few people of color beyond mid-management roles. "

My personal reasons for leaving were the nature of the work and the disorganization of the department. In fraud, you\'ll take nonstop calls from both pleasant, and not-so-pleasant customers (mostly the latter). Over time, the nonstop calls can be downright exhausting. To make matters worse, fraud is the ""dump department"" that every other team transfers to when they don\'t want to deal with an upset customer (even if the issue isn\'t fraud-related). Management was informed on numerous occasions about how other departments abuse transfers, but they never did anything about it. That just added additional stress to the job. Another issue was the verification processes put in place for customers. The options available sucked. More often than not, I was unable to assist customers with their accounts due to the complicated verification steps we had to follow. I hated having to turn customers away, or lock their accounts for the most minuscule issues, especially during the holidays and for emergencies. Customers were always on hold for ridiculous amounts of time, so to be turned away for verification issues was not a good look when it comes to providing great customer service. "
Capital-One,1f9fg7tgcs7ln800,4,Fun workplace with great culture,Sr. Business Analyst,"Smart people, inclusive culture, great work-life balance.Data driven company, so feels different from traditional banks. Would recommend the company"
Capital-One,1f99htnsdocrl800,2,"Pretty good place to start, not a great place to grow",Senior Business Analyst,"When you first start out of college, I think there\'s pretty generous pay. There\'s also a good program that sets you up with a lot of other cohorts that graduated from college. They teach you a lot about the ""culture"" of working at Capital One, for better or worse. And honestly, it seemed like only the college students were getting promoted. The professional hires languished for years before a promotion.Also, after you get a few years of experience (and especially if you\'re in the tech field), you will not be compensated properly. Start looking after a few years. And if you\'re a professional hire, expect promotions to be the exception rather than the norm. Spend your time on ""resume"" projects, get some certs, and don\'t let the work consume you. "
Capital-One,1f98rpsenocrl800,3,Overwhelming ,Fraud Account Supervisor,"Job started out great first 2 years. This place and the way of management has went down. The managers are lazy and sorry. All they care about is Metrics and not helping you. They also play favoritism amongst the workers. Enjoys to write you up for everything.  Since the pandemic it has gotten worst. Stressed out, working from home. No time in between calls, barely can take a bathroom break and get a breather.  Managers are very sneaky so be careful. "
Capital-One,1f975l3basaaf800,4,Very demanding and competitive environment,Director,"Great company to work for. Very demanding performance management system, Pressure to perform and perform at a high level (a good thing overall). Very smart people around you to challenge you and make you better."

Capital-One,1f8eiaot0s7nm800,4,Collaborative Environment Yet Still Opportunities For Career Advancement,Associate Software Engineer,One of my favorite aspects of the my time here has the environment - in my experience it hasn't been super competitive. Everyone works together to get the work done and you aren't having to fight others for promotions or to stay in the company. The company is surprisingly modern with it's tech usage/tech stack - i.e. you won't be writing COBOL for mainframes like you may at other banks (as far as I know).
Capital-One,1f8dbskvbs7nm800,3,It really depends on the team and leader,Data Analysis Manager,"I think it really depends on the team and the leadership for someone's individual experience. Much of Capital One staff comes from other organizations and some teams are great, while others are known to be a challenge. Overall, senior leadership has a good ethos embodied by the CEO. However, People Leadership is not a quality heavily emphasized during the performance management process. Capital One really strives to be a technology and data analytics-focused company and is emulating many of the tech strategies developed by major Tech companies. The bank is also changing and maturing over time. I've been told it is a different experience from now compared to past days of just being a Credit Card company. I'll likely be leaving the department or Capital One to do something different due to the difficulty of working with some leadership stakeholders in my organization. To be honest, my career at Capital One has been a very trying experience; while I generally like the Brand overall. While it has been a challenging experience overall, I think that is likely due to some stakeholders I worked with the past few years. My advice, really try to get to know the culture of your leadershiop and team. "
Capital-One,1f8b7jomtnpuh800,3,Some good benefits but a lot of favoritism,Customer Resolutions tier 2,"It seems great at first then you see their true colors Management states they are to help but no one is ever available Working from made it harder , especially if asked a question in the group chat and no one responded Unless you were a favorite employee then there's always someone available to answer questions, help with an assignment, difficult calls or just in general."
Capital-One,1f8avqlqis7nm800,4,"Its not the worse job in the world, but definitely not the best when it comes down to working from home",FAMISE ,"i love the capital one, its a good job, its just the call center aspect can be insanely stressful depending on what you do. advancing within the company can be slightly impossible unless youre willing to keep making lateral moves until you reach a decent promotion that doesnt stress you out too much. I sometimes considered leaving all together due to the insanely stressful queues and sometimes back to back calls."
Capital-One,1f87nq2oh3kkc000,4,Grear culture ,Sr. Commercial Loan Analyst,"This was probably the best place I ever worked. Managers are great, they have a very good work culture. Managers always stressed family first. We could work remote way before the pandemic. "
Capital-One,1f85jdldn3gtf000,5,Recovery,Sr. Risk Coordinator,Love love it. I would recommend to anyone.. give it a shot. Capital One is very big on changing with the times so they also are big on diversity they support groups of color and they will also give you a raise generously
Capital-One,1f80m7pj8o28m800,1,"Loved it in the beginning, then after being stuck in the same role for over a year I realized the grass was not greener on this side",Collections Agent,"If you are on the phones, there is no opportunity to grow. You can only grow if you leave the company or be willing to take on extra work for the same pay in hopes that you can get a raise. Also, for a company that received millions in aid from the government, it's really funny to me that the company almost didn't give out raises after the hectic year we had. Then the raises turned out to not even be at least 50 cents. Just pitiful. Don't let the Fortune 500 rankings fool you, unless you're closer to the top of the food chain then you are just a number. The company pays its phone workers pennies to get yelled at and verbally harassed by customers and you have managers who like to interfere with employees getting bonuses. A positive I will say is that Capital One is a very diverse working environment and even though it is work at home for some, there are a lot of company events that encourage inclusivity. You don't get that just anywhere. "
Capital-One,1f7urelgku1m4800,5,Great Place,Account Specialist,Great place to work for. Would recommend anyone to start out as you do progress. The pay is good for the workload and the people are incredible to work with.

Capital-One,1f7m7r2g2n52t800,2,"Managers are great, company as a whole....not so much",Customer Service Representative,I have been working for capital one for 2 years now and have worked under 2 different managers officially. There are many managers at capital one and from my experience they are all great. I believe that the managers do really care about their teams but I don't think that capital one does. I know many people who are struggling mentally between covid and moving to a work from home environment and we have managers tell us to use our different resources that are available but capital one seems to make it hard for us to use any of the resources that would be most beneficial. When we have gaps between calls and you get denied for a mental health leave due to staffing requirements it definitely feels like they care more about meeting goals than their employees mentality. 
Capital-One,1f7he6oodu26j800,3,Corporate has great aspirations ,Front Line Manager,"Workplace culture here is diverse, accepting, and welcoming - at the corporate level. However, that isn't always reflected at the local level. Great place to work if you are content with not advancing in a career, have friends in high places, or if you like playing office politics. Reporting issues to HR/AR is hit or miss in whether they take it seriously. Management is expected to work during off-hours and there is no work-life balance. Setting that boundary of only working during your hours leads to discipline. Most enjoyable part of the job was the resources available to employees, including free classes to grow skills. If you are on the phones, though, you won't ever have time to take advantage of these.  "
Capital-One,1f7a8c0dc3kis000,1,Horrible politics ,AML Investigator,"The AML Department is a joke, they give you 10 hours worth of work in an 8 hour workday and will not accept excuses. Their pay is well below industry standards. The only way to get promoted is by being a manager\xe2\x80\x99s favorite. The compliance testing department isn\xe2\x80\x99t any better. It\xe2\x80\x99s toxic and unless \xe2\x80\x9cthey like you\xe2\x80\x9d you are treated as an outsider and they find reasons to let you aka \xe2\x80\x9cre-deploy\xe2\x80\x9d you. "

Capital-One,1f77h9tpis9vq800,2,"Great people, bad company policies",Customer Service Call Center Representative,"I work as a call center agent and boy has it been a roller coaster. First of all, yes! Capital one has amazing benefits! They will pay into your 401k and you can purchase stock at a discount. You get amazing health benefits if you work full time. However, the way the call centers work currently while remote makes it hard to want to stay. My current position is an acquirer and you are expected to do pretty much every other roles\xe2\x80\x99 jobs or you experience pushback from others. You are expected to continue to take calls even after extremely stressful calls. You must comply with all regulatory policies to protect the bank and follow steps given while servicing the customer, all within 380 seconds. Don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong\xe2\x80\x94 the people who work here are some of the most amazing people you will meet. Your manager will do everything to try and support you. But the bank is making big decisions leading to customer dissatisfaction, in turn causing them to take it out on you (understandable frustration, because this is their money). Right now they are making big changes on the systems we are using causing a lot of servicing issues. I was also permitted to relocate because this position has turned into fully-remote, and then told a month later that I must move back or I will lose this job. This job is insanely taxing on your mental health. Please be prepared. "
Capital-One,1f76r38t1s7es800,4,Great company that cares about you as a person,Sr. Fraud Coordinator,I've been with Capital One for almost 2 years. I was hired to work from home so Covid didn't impact me except for the call volume that's very hard to keep up with. There used to be a few minutes between calls and now there aren't even a few seconds. Burn out is so real but my manager has always worked with me so that I feel supported and cared about. 
Capital-One,1f6vqb18hs9vq800,4,Innovation at every turn,Engineering Manager,"Very smart and motivated people. Always pushing the boundaries. Business is all in on being data-driven.Can be political at times, especially as you move up the corporate ladder."
Capital-One,1f6th3njd3obs000,3,Great company except performance management is cancerous,Senior Business Analyst,Great wlb and culture. Performance management is on a curve and determined by how willing and able he/she is to advocate for you. If your manager doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like you or is a weak debater you are screwed. Political process like mean girls meets the hunger games. Ten percent get managed out and you can\xe2\x80\x99t always avoid it for the aforementioned reasons.

During my time there, we were treated to nice perks, such as drawings for great merchandise, game day, food truck day...it seems like it was something planned every week! "
Capital-One,1f6no744mhijp800,1,Horrible company ,Customer Service Representative,"Company does not care if you have a family or health issues going on. They do not treat employees fairly, will allow some time off to some people for not great reasons and then when I asked to be off so I could attend more grief counseling and they denied me. So glad to no longer be apart of this company. Definitely beware! "

But when it come to not meeting the company metrics, expectations, They won\xe2\x80\x99t place you else where that best fits you. You could do mostly everything great, but that one thing you lack ( BP ) you will get terminated rather than being placed in a different department that best suits you. And once your gone, you can NEVER come back. But overall I enjoyed my team and managers. "
Capital-One,1f6kpo7b4s7j3800,5,Perfect Job,Client Onboarding Manager,"Perfect Job, All pros no cons, great people and constant education opportunities available for any job you want. I feel truly blessed to have been given the opportunities I have been in. The only possible drawback is the annual employee review process, it can sometimes be subjective to what your manager thinks of you personally. Metrics always come into play but they are dependent on how lenient your manager might be. Especially if you are in a consultative role or client facing. "
Capital-One,1f68hckqeu3a7800,4,Temporaries were treated like 2nd class citizens,Customer Service/Collections,"Although as a temp i was expected to meet the same guidelines and statistics there was always a difference made.  You were of course disposable and definitely also made to feel that way and unappreciated.  often you were working harder than the perms because you wanted to flip but it wasn\'t recognized.  My manager did nothing to assist me in developing.  To get considered or flip toperm was totally subjective and based on if your manager liked you, not how well you did your job.  Team building exercises werent for the temps.  They would leave you there to cover the perms while the rest of the team to ""bond."""

Instructions were clear and I stayed on track easily even without previous experience in risk management.Senior titles in Capital One seems to correspond to junior titles in other financial institutes.

Titles may be misleading in Capital One."

Capital-One,1f5m38cr3sa39800,2,Going downhill as an employer,Customer Care Representative,"I have worked for Capital One twice now and the last time I loved it so much I wanted to come back and I wanted to RETIRE at Capital One.  My goal was to be on the phones for a year or so, and work hard to get promoted off the phones. I was top in my department for the first few months.  Then the Pandemic hit.  And it went downhill from there.  If you\'re taking a on the phone position, I recommend NOT to.  They want you to reach all these metrics (even more so now that we are working from home) that sometimes it\'s simply IMPOSSIBLE to do.  It\'s all based on luck.  If you take 200 calls and your manager grades the 5 bad ones you had all month, you get no incentive and written up if it happens again.  My typical day at work is filled with dread and regret.  I log in, get 10 minutes to read through emails and what not then take inbound calls with people who can or can not pay their credit cards.  I listen to people who are 90 days past due and still can\'t make payments and we can\'t do anything for them because our hands our tied.  I reach out to managers to try and get help, only to be told there\'s nothing we can do and to just tell them to keep calling - even though we all know nothing will happen.Also, the company throws around this whole ""We want you to focus on your mental health and wellbeing"", but the moment you try you need 30 letters from doctors on WHY.  And if the doctor says even one good thing about you, they decline it. And don\'t try using the bathroom more than twice and only on your breaks, or you\'ll need a letter from the doctor on why you go to the bathroom"

But since sending us home it was a mess. Completely unorganized training, brutal call volume, it feels like we\xe2\x80\x99ve been turned into numbers. They also now go out of their way to not accommodate people with illnesses. I would say it\xe2\x80\x99s still a good company to work for, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve gone downhill severely."

Most of the workload is placed on a few individuals while there is no accountability for the others that are needed to make the machine work. Workload to compensation ratio is not adequate. "

They of course cared about stats but in the last year it seems like that's all they care about. Before COVID most of the week there was at least 5-10 min between calls now there isn't even 5-10 seconds. burn out is real. The card holders aren't bad. "
Capital-One,1f4d1v309u39f800,2,For all seeking growth beware ,Senior Risk Coordinator,Beware!! Management will promote based on a who knows who and statistics and ratings rarely play a role. ECU and ESG for escalations are a trap department and capital one will put a \xe2\x80\x9cfreeze\xe2\x80\x9d on the ability to post out to other departments keeping you stagnant 
Capital-One,1f4cj4fbit5m6800,5,Electrifyingly fast-paced,"Manager, Process Management","This was like walking up to a treadmill set at TEN and having to get on. When you succeed, it\xe2\x80\x99s exhilarating. The annual bonus process is extremely stress-inducing and competition is cutthroat. Definitely, give it a whirl. A great learning experience. "
Capital-One,1f4a0nqjksa8r800,5,loyal to their employees,Sr account manager,they take really good care of their employees and are super understanding about life happening. The benefits are awesome and there is a real sense of family amongst the coworkers. They also give back to the community which is awesome.
Capital-One,1f47kbrbou1vt800,3,"Don't walk, run",Customer Service Coordinator,"*The pay is great ($15 minimum), and the benefits are good (12 weeks paid maternity leave, 8 weeks paid paternity leave, 20 days PTO, etc.).*Not a day goes by that I don't get call a derogatory term or cussed at.*Management is aware, but nothing changes. *There is very little room to move up in the company. *Lastly, account holders will blame you for everything from getting a late fee to interest to being in collections."
Capital-One,1f40kcoabu1vt800,4,Great company to work for,Lead Teller,"Capital One was a great Bank to work but job security was a problem. They started closing to many bank locations, which led to many people loosing jobs. "
Capital-One,1f3vv7tlrs7ju800,5,Very positive and friendly environment ,Customer Service Associate,"Working at Capital One was one of my favorite jobs. Great and friendly environment,  managers were very caring and helped employees succeed. Some days can feel a little long but the company made it's employees feel important and did a lot of special things."
Capital-One,1f3qqf65uu20v800,5,Productive fun work place ,Customer Service Representative,Opportunity for advancement great culture fun employees great training program and work satisfication.  Diverse associates and feel valued as an employee.
Capital-One,1f3ivpbi9ocr1800,3,Unclear goals and lack of support from Leaders,Operations Manager,There is a lack of inclusion and career goal support from leaders. Management does not consider the skillset and career aspirations when making decisions. There is a lack of trust . TOO much change.
Capital-One,1f3gcsp5fu3dj800,4,Productive and fun,Sr. DevOps Engineer,Great place to learn and adapt to latest technologies.The management is supportive and all the teams have great attitude towards work.people are quick to adapt to new tech.

Capital-One,1f3atabenu3bc800,3,Management ,Call Center Representative - Work from Home,"They train you for two weeks then just put you on the phones. They want you to use 8-15 systems at a time when assisting cx. They want you to use two systems to verify cx. The systems never have a global update they tell you to clear cookies and clich\xc3\xa9s every time you\xe2\x80\x99re having a system issue, or uninstall and reinstall. They tell to depend on a systems that pulls up articles to used when stuck, or call Advo/Sup/Mgr for assistance and some are rude! It takes forever for them to except PTO, Vaca, etc. there is a lot more."
Capital-One,1f39cgujsu3bc800,4,Great place to work ,Risk Coordinator,The job was amazing when we were still in the center (before covid) they have many groups for all walks of life. LGBTQ+ friendly and supportive. Pay was amazing also receive bonuses. Gave prizes and gifts to boost morale and all around a great company 
Capital-One,1f380se593guf000,4,Great company ,Banker,"The company started as a credit card company and went into banking. All things considered, it was a good experience. I was in the certified banker program and that was a great learning experience but the direction of where they took it never was clear. "
Capital-One,1f31rgbm0him2800,2,Overworked and Underpaid,Branch Ambassador,"The company has taught me a lot but has changed since it combined its roles and the pandemic hit. We have fewer branches, staff, and more responsibilities, management is too busy juggling zoom calls and hosting meetings to assist with a customer or branch-related things besides sending you an email to fix it. Operations are a hot mess as every market and branch have a ""different"" way of doing things meaning you may put your job at risk over a practice one branch does, but not yours. Associates are basically on a free-for-all with no consequences for behavioral opportunities i.e. time and attendance. Consistency is a huge issue and there is no work-life balance because you\'re expected to be on-call at all times. So sad as the culture used to be great and it felt you can grow, now you\'re encouraged to harass recruiters to help you apply for a job within the company that you aren\'t qualified for because they aren\'t any positions besides branch ambassador. They also recently combined branch call support with overseas workers who do nothing but read off a screen and have no prior banking experience meaning you\'re basically on your own to figure things out. This is a great job for someone young just starting, needs a pass time job, or needs a college part-time, besides that you\'ll find yourself drained between work, management, and the customers. Run!!"
Capital-One,1f2ped5br309g000,4,The work that we do ,Sr Service and Credit Review Coordinator,Capitalone is a great place to work and there benefits are some of the best.The only negative I have is how hard it is to move up from my position. If you do not want to be a unit manager then there is really no where else to move up to
Capital-One,1f2mclgep3ki8000,3,Great job,Customer Service Representative,Work from home position prior to COVID managers were ok as well as pay. There was little to no room for growth as most positions seemed to be filled with folks that had been in the company for years. I gave 4 stars due to benefits as they were really good.
Carmax,1ffbu5n0qu3a4800,5,Amazing People,Business Office Associate,"The main reason people leave a place of work is due to management or their coworkers but that was absolutely not the case here. Everybody I worked with was incredibly supportive and knowledgeable. It\xe2\x80\x99s an environment where you constantly learn new things and questions are welcomed. There are also amazing benefits such as paid sick leave, PTO, free counseling and other services. "
Carmax,1flh1kk9ss7is800,4,Productive workplace ,Inventory Associate,I worked in the Inventory department. Nice job for young people who like cars. There a multiple different shifts. Work wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too stressful and the employees were nice.
Carmax,1flagva2fo260801,5,fun work place,Inventory Specialist,"good fun work pays , pays little   was very fun at times but then also got boring and managament sometimes wasnt the best                                                                 "
Carmax,1fla0qglhu1l4802,1,Fake work environment,Car Sales,"Socialist \xe2\x80\x9cbonus\xe2\x80\x9d pay structure. \xe2\x80\x9cCross functional\xe2\x80\x9d means more work and less pay. Associates have favorites and give others more work.  Carmax makes associates pay for the carmax gear like sweatshirts ($80-$150) and you are not allowed to wear any non-carmax clothing, which makes sense, but you have to work outside in the cold so you\xe2\x80\x99re forced to buy their clothing."
Carmax,1fl3n2cacu1l4801,2,I got along very well with most customers ,Business Office Associate,"Very busy place. Which I like but too much micromanagement.  Too many people calling out to you to do different things. Three business office leads, quite rude and crude. I didn't like the work environment "
Carmax,1fl3a87met4vo802,4,Great Company with a few Cons  ,Business Office Lead,"This company will take care of you pay wise if you have the correct experience and if you ask for the pay. They give $3-$5 raises a year compared to my old company that would do MAX $1 a year that\xe2\x80\x99s amazing. There are pros and cons to every job and of course the cons are. First is that the dealership is busy at ALL times. You also are graded on Accuracy and Surveys that each customer takes on your performance. The one that really really sucks is CarMax\xe2\x80\x99s time & attendance policy. They go based off a point system and when you receive 2pts you have a verbal warning and by 3pts a write up and by 6pts that\xe2\x80\x99s termination. You CANNOT be 1 MINUTE late or you will receive half a point(.5). If you call out and have no sick time, you receive a point. If you are running late 1 hr you receive 1 whole point. If you want to leave early for whatever reason you receive a point for leaving early. They do not have a grace period and are very serious about the policy. "
Carmax,1fl26imebn59v802,5,"Can be a great workplace, depending on which department you're in.",Service Advisor,"CarMax is honestly one of the best places I have worked for. In most of the departments they work with scheduling to be as flexible as they can, they tend to be happy and easy to work with, and the compensation can be great. However the service department side of the company pays a very low wage compared to other dealerships, as well as requires much longer hours than most other departments or dealerships."
Carmax,1fklvfek5hij7802,2,Good concept not so good working enviorment,Sales Manager,Good sales training but the management will constantly look over your shoulder.  Hardest part of the job is convincing customers that there is no negotiation on the price of the vehicle.
Carmax,1fkjm2ll7npu2802,1,Manager play favorite with associates.,Lead Business Office Associate,"Questionable management and promotion in the store level.  Managers play favor with associates.  If your manager like you, you can be anything or do anything and you will not get punished for."
Carmax,1fkiuce9nu3hf800,2,Cool coworkers and good pay,Auto Body Technician,Managers don\xe2\x80\x99t care about you unless you\xe2\x80\x99re one of their favorites. You can be the hardest worker but they\xe2\x80\x99ll move someone else up just cuz that\xe2\x80\x99s their favorite. Only thing good about this job is the pay kinda. Some detailers make the same amount of money as a body tech which is ridiculous. You can\xe2\x80\x99t trust anybody here and when you keep to yourself and keep your head down and work they\xe2\x80\x99ll write you up for having bad attitude. This place is only good for people wanting to learn how to do body work and people who are nearing retirement and don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do hard labor body work anymore and want a chill job before they retire.
Carmax,1fkbar73ou3lr802,3,Good pay and benefits ,Auto Repair Specialist ,"Don't receiver proper training, expected t just figure it out, can't count on management because most of the time they don't know. No room to move up or learn new things "
Carmax,1fk5gkrhho2bv801,3,Pay needs to be higher ,Sales Associate,"Good work environment but pay is definitely lacking, management is very helpful but as a sales consultant you believe it\xe2\x80\x99s because they know you\xe2\x80\x99re getting the bad end of the stick"
Carmax,1fk3umio2t52e802,5,Management and the team,Business Office Associate,Everyone there makes me feel welcomed even the manager. They work with you and make sure that if you have any questions they answer them. I love working for this company so far.
Carmax,1fk2vpd29u3l6802,5,Awesome Work Environment ,Off Lot Transporter,"Love this job . A great employer understands that you have other things to take care of outside of work. By having a flexible start and end time, you can more easily make time for appointments, family obligations and personal matters. While a flexible schedule isn't possible for every type of career, you may want to consider going into a career that gives you more freedom."
Carmax,1fk29d797t4de800,1,"Poor management,  poor leadership ",Double diamond sales consultant ,"Worst place ever to work, stressful, paycuts often, long hours, no offdays , dishonest people and everyday practice. Company hires anybody with a pulse."
Carmax,1fk072l07u53l802,3,Favoritism,Coordinator II Central Business Operations,"While working at CarMax, is fantastic... not every department is created equal. If you are looking for a role at CarMax, you should look every where EXCEPT in Central Business Operations. All the other departments are treated fairly and equally, however this department gets nothing in the way of funding, or incentives. Also, The management in  this department knows about the same as what you know about the job, and that is nothing! They also look for and seek out one person each that they want to prep, mold, and train to be promoted, while the employees who have been there the longest get passed over every single time. They do not look for the person who is most qualified either, the people they try to promote also have no understanding of the actual job functions. This department is a failure. But if you want a job where management pretends to care about you, says they are going to help you succeed and don't, then look no further because this department is for you."
Carmax,1fjuqkkcju53l802,2,CarMax wants to grow but at the cost of their employees,Business Office Associate,"CarMax was a fun place to work, but when they wanted to expand after the pandemic closures, they loaded way too much on the Business Office Associates. From checking in titles, tracking dmv checks, being the main POC ador the entire store, even doing home deliveries and not getting any benefit from them. Some home deliveries were 30+ miles from the store and deprived the Business Office of staffing. The call center (awful idea) made too many issues for the sales consultants physically at the store. The sales consultants at the store are NOT paid well enough for the work that they do. They had rubbish discounts on cars too. "
Carmax,1fjunia63u53k800,5,Great place to work,Vehicle Condition Assessor,Worked at Carmax for a year or two as a vehicle condition accessor overall it was a great job. Benefits were really good. All the managers were nice and easy going. 
Carmax,1fjqoqmtbt4bb800,1,Pay does not fit responsibility ,Early Collections Agent,False advertisement when posting job. Pay is less than what was stated and the hours are trash. Stated it would be wfh but wants you to come into the office whenever they change their minds. No work life balance unreal expectations and you have to do another departments work for no no additional compensation 
Carmax,1fjp1smq3o2h2801,3,Good for beginners,Sales Consultant for Internet and Floor Sales,"Management completely disengaged, pay is lowest in industry, training is adequate but not hands on- it\xe2\x80\x99s online for 6 weeks, overall the company is not the best "
Carmax,1fjjbr3lho2h2800,5,good place to work,Sales Consultant,good benefits and culture . compensation package changed but has okay pay . commission only no base rate unless work from home . culture varies from store to store. long interview process 
Carmax,1fjhng1tpu1t1800,5,Very laid back atmosphere but the pay it’s kinda low,Sales Associate,It was fine it just sucked when customers are constantly calling you and you have to come in on days off a lot to close deals and work a lot on the weekends.
Carmax,1fjhh6qoqu1am801,1,"The managers at CarMax has favorites and if you aren’t one of them, you will get treated like dirt.",Car Detailer,"Multiple associates have complained to the Lead Manager at CarMax about how unprofessional some managers are, but nothing is being done about it. Would not recommend working here. "
Carmax,1fjh272b8t4b9800,5,was a great company to work for,Mechanic Associate Level 3,honestly loved everything about the job. was stuck on second shift and was not able to cover my shift anymore so had to leave. would go back if able!!
Carmax,1fjgubvc0u1t1802,2,People in charge with no experience to the job ,Transporter/Driver,Not a bad place to work if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind a boss telling you to \xe2\x80\x9cstay in your lane and do what you\xe2\x80\x99re told\xe2\x80\x9d kind of attitude. Other than that it can be a good place if the stress level wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so high. 
Carmax,1fjehlsv0u2hh802,2,Change in Management ,Inventory ,Since a change in store management many employees that have worked there for years have been let go. Some parts of managment lack major communication and if they do communicate it is very sarcastic
Carmax,1fjbja9g3t4l8800,3,Beware,Central Business Operations - Coordinator II,"Please read all.... CarMax as a company, is a great company. The benefits were good and the pay was good. The culture is great and I feel like they have decent PTO .  I would recommend working anywhere in CarMax EXCEPT Central Business Operations at the Home Office. The managers play major favorites, they don't even try to hide it. They do absolutely NOTHING to help when behind and just sit there in their meetings and do well nothing. They do nothing because they don't know anything about the actual work. They say they understand when you get behind, which is always because they just pile and pile and pile more and more work on you, but they don't understand. They just want to hit that bottom goal to keep them from being looked at as a department, which someone really needs to. But again, when favorites get into power by upper management they always look the other way. They give little training to get you ready for the job before throwing you into it.. They also do nothing to bridge the gap from the Home Office to the stores. Central Business Operations is a place where your drive, ambition, and your hopes go to die. Work anywhere else in CarMax, as like I said CarMax is a good company (for the most part anyways) except this department. "
Carmax,1fja9062qu23q802,1,"decent pay, disgusting management",Business Office Associate,"Most managers in the business office seem to be bad. Unhelpful, demanding, and will give you the boot first chance they get if you don't fit their demanding standards of perfection. Pay is decent, but stay part time. Manager can make or break the feel of the place. You're better off somewhere else for the compensation."
Carmax,1fj90rqk3u23q802,2,Watch your back,Senior Sales Consultant,Carmax has a great business model and you can make good money there if you're good in sales.  The managers however will not have your best interest in mind and if they don't like you you'll be treated unfairly.  Your co-workers may or may not be helpful or honest (it's commission sales after all) so be careful of getting customers taken from you.
Carmax,1fj7dkr7poc9d801,1,Toxic work environment,Customer Service Representative,"Can\xe2\x80\x99t hire people that want to work , management is so micromanaging no team work at all. Too many Managers not on the same page .Managers are coming from Target and recruiting their own . Do not promote within hire from outside which makes their long term employees feel unwanted and un motivated. People last a day and don\xe2\x80\x99t return . So much accountability for the amount of wage and this location is so high volume you can\xe2\x80\x99t function with emphasis on customer service because it\xe2\x80\x99s so busy from the moment you open to sometimes 11pm  or later. No life ! Mandatory overtime because always have call outs and short handed to begin with . No time to train new hires which means more work for the loyal long term employees. Management un approachable and unhelpful. Always looking to find your faults . Too worried about themselves and not their dept cuz the pressure is so high all the time . Worst company to work for , stay away. Back stabbing coworkers beware! Rated on every transaction and accountable with observations regardless of your defense. "
Carmax,1fj56es5ou2hh802,4,Management is great as well as pay,Sales Professional,"Great place to work, co workers are amazing as well as management. Judgement free zone and they hold you to a high standard. Which as an employee makes me feel like I matter in the company"
Carmax,1fj3mlbact3ok800,5,Great workplace with lots of advancement opportunities ,Lead Business Office Associate,"Worked there for 4 years. Great place to work. I was a lead business office associate and loved it. My favorite part was my co-workers. Carmax has a way of hiring very like minded people, so you\xe2\x80\x99ll love your coworkers "
Carmax,1fj17t9kbu1lk801,4,High energy fun place to work,Sales Associate,"Fun place to work, but to many sales people. Great training and advancement. A great customer base and honest auto sales. My time there was fun but you have to work hard."
Carmax,1fj15k7m2nq2f800,4,Pretty good easy job,Buyer's Assistant,"Carmax was definitely the best dealership I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked at, they worked with my schedule and it was a nice environment. They treat everyone the same regardless of your title "
Carmax,1fivh0fl4u24k802,1,favoritism ,CDAD,worked there for about 8 months and it got worse and worse the managers pick their favorites and have them do less work. The work environment is very much 20% of the people do 80% of the work. They don\xe2\x80\x99t listen if you need time off or need to be able to have a flexible schedule they would rather you just go part time then them working with you. 
Carmax,1fiu1i2ciu26k801,3,Pay is low for as much work as you do ,Inventory Associate,"Decent place to work, benefits are good, one problem is they don\xe2\x80\x99t promote within but hire outside that no nothing about the company or cars, lots of mandatory overtime but pays bonus in points to company store "
Carmax,1fitqktvmhir4802,4,Ethical company with commendable business practices ,Customer Experience Consultant,"CarMax has grown to enormous size and and success because of the reputation they have earned. It is very refreshing to work for a company that strives to always do the right thing and to always be honest. Customers see that and it is reflected in their loyalty to CarMax. The pay is fair for the work although the bonus structure is less than desirable. But, the hourly rate is decent and bonus checks are frequent - they are just confusing to calculate and difficult to keep track of accuracy. There are lots of benefits offered but the quantity does not equal the quality. 401k match is awesome while health insurance premiums are a little pricey, and paid time off is severely lacking. The way you earn sick time is  not practical- less than hour a week, so you can only get sick for one day and only after two full months before you would start accruing points per the attendance policy. Vacation time is sub-par too. You don\xe2\x80\x99t start accruing any till after 90 days and you will only earn 10 days a year. The ability to work completely remote is awesome and all equipment is provided. Training is okay but it could be better. It is not easy to get support after you are out of your training class and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like your manager is really \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x9d to help out. Overall I feel like I work for a great company and have tons of growth opportunities and plan to be there a long time. "
Carmax,1fissrp1thieb802,1,Horrible place to work,Sales Manager,The face of this company is a $9 an hour call center employee who is overwhelmed and poorly trained and it just gets worse from there. Everything here is broken and no one with the desire to fix it has the ability. This company has given up.
Carmax,1fin4thj1u48j802,1,Good for a starting sales job,Sales Consultant,The company says they are focused on associates and pay fairly but most associates are overworked and the pay is low compared to other commissioned jobs. 
Carmax,1fimhpggbt4qn801,5,Good,Cashier/Customer Service,Its fun and the managers are nice and its a good environment the employees are very nice as well as the customers that have fun with us cause they want to buy a car 
Carmax,1fikbss3qt4qn802,2,It will consume your life ,Sales Associate,You like working solely off commission meaning you could earn unlimited money or not make a dime . Yiu want to work overtime everyday and not get paid extra.  Well carmax is for you here at carmax they don't care how many hours you work cause the pay is commission only . Some days you work 9 hrs other 10+   and don't think your schedule will be nice yiu get a weekend every 6 weeks and be lucky if your days off are back to back . They work you like a dog and befor you know it you've worked 50 hrs in a week ..  
Carmax,1fihdngf8sa5p802,5,Secure place to work with advancement opportunities,Customer Service Representative,"Overall,  Carmax is a good place to work. They offer flexible schedules and do things to show they care about their employees. During Covid, the CEO took a large pay cut just to keep us employed. I have a lot of respect for the company. The only thing I dislike is I feel like you have to know the right people in order to move into certain roles. "
Carmax,1figdgbthsa7c801,1,Your life will change. And it’s not what you think.,Operations ,"If you are an energetic, positive person who enjoys being around people, stay away from Carmax. Their culture and poor management will kill your personality and turn you into a robot. You can work for Carmax for years and be replaced, just like that. Again, stay away."
Carmax,1fifskq6io2ac802,3,Okay Work,Inventory Associate,"I worked for this company a year and a half. I enjoyed most of my time, but ultimately left due to no real opportunity for advancement. They have a detailed management training plan to get you there, but you are at the mercy of current management to actually sign you off through the process. "
Carmax,1fifl0jart3pq802,2,They preach “family” but the company takes every chance they get to take money from their sales people ,Sales Consultant,The way the company has set up their commission structure with the call center is very unfortunate for its real sales people. There are some deals you can make as low as $40 selling a car.. all this company cares about is pushing volume and nothing about actual customers. The only chance to make money is to get in presidents club and even then it\xe2\x80\x99s no more that a $60-65k a year job for most. 
Carmax,1fibkm007n52s802,2,Don't waste your time ,Sales Consultant,"You do meet great people while working here & people with big hearts. However they have no regard for your personal life as far as scheduling , if you need time off they'll give it to you but you literally work all day everyday. You do not receive the same treatment as a senior associate and it's not hidden. Occasionally certain managers will throw you to the wolves with certain customer issues and avoid intervening as much as possible. They hassle you about things they won't hassle the next associate with. They also tend to call you constantly during your break. As a new associate you are put thru an evaluation period that determines whether or not you remain apart of the company and they do not thoroughly explain that period and how that system works which pushes you to be discouraged because you know at the end of the day your job is not guaranteed if you don't meet a certain number of points and the points are not fairly added in all reality. Once again you do meet some unforgettable fun & loving individuals but overall it isn't that great of an experience. "
Carmax,1fi8t7kk4u1ns800,4,Nice management,Customer Experience Consultant,"Management is great but there is no real work-life balance. The benefits are pretty good and they will typically work with your schedule. Unfortunately, the expected numbers they want you to reach daily is extremely hard to achieve which then makes the pay not so great."
Carmax,1fi78k8sqsa0n800,5,Was A great atmosphere to work in,Vehicle Condition Assessor,Working at CarMax was great. The managers and coworkers actually care about their employees and the experience made the job a lot better to be at. I highly recommend working here. The pay was also okay and good and they include benefits for full time employees. 
Carmax,1fi50qi4tn52s801,4,Great people,Inventory Associate,"We have a great inventory staff and the pay is fair, sometimes nights can be stressful but that is when people get off work. Overall it is not a bad job to have"
Carmax,1fhqkupuvt3rt802,5,Great company ,SERVICE DRIVE OPERATIONS MANAGER,Loved working here They have a great atmosphere and there is plenty of room to advance. If you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a fun job that has good pay this is the one for you
Carmax,1fhp2vm66u4ba800,1,Worst job ever,Business Office Associate,"I stayed far too long at this job due to job security & trying to find something way better, but I was ECSTATIC finally getting to leave this past Feb. 2021. Don\xe2\x80\x99t know why they announce that they offer work-life balance when it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist. Pay was extremely low for such a heavy workload during my time there from 2018-2021, and recently heard they raised it to what we should have gotten all along these last few years, but even then still not enough at all for the workload. Hours were terrible, management was even worse (lots of favoritism) and coworkers act as friends who just end up talking bad about you for every little thing. Such a toxic environment, and it affected my mental health so negatively & I am so grateful and fortunate to have left. Wish it would have had a different outcome, but the Naperville location specifically ruined my views on ever working for the company ever again. Among many other things that happened at my time there, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even recommend working here to someone desperate for a job. Such a greedy and unprofessional company. "
Carmax,1fhoa42unu1hk802,1,Horrible Company to work for...,Inventory Associate,"If you take pride in yourself and love your sanity, don't work here they will never make you feel appreciated and they'll work you to the bone. Also if you're reporting another associate that's a favorite... forget about keeping your job you'll be fired almost instantly. Management is also a joke when it comes to favorites. But hey if you're up for a challenge maybe carmax is the place for you."
Carmax,1fhg7fhb8t66d802,2,"Working with other sales consultants, getting advise/tips on how to sell vehicles and maxcare warranty ",Sales Consultant,"Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend. Pay is 9$ an hour for base rate and that what you will get paid from rather than your sales money if you\xe2\x80\x99re not selling enough vehicles /max care warranty. Management tries to get you to sell at least 7-8 cars (with the warranty) per week regardless if it\xe2\x80\x99s a not a good month or season where people normally shop for cars.(sale numbers tend to drop a lot more around that time) Make about 150$ per vehicle sale (with max care warranty an extra 100$), appraisal\xe2\x80\x99s are 50$. Could be much better"
Carmax,1fhegn24eo2id801,5,Great company to work with!,Sales Associate,Great people. Great company. Good compensation if you work hard. Health insurance is expensive for family plan otherwise everything is good. Prepare for weekly huddles to improve your sales skills. Open door policy.
Carmax,1fh9q2f49s9uh802,5,Sales,Sales Consultant,Good place to work. Good pay but is straight commission. Like all sales job you get what you put in it. Must work weekends and Holidays but thats car sales for you. I would definitely recommend Carmax as a place to work if your interested in Cars and Sales.
Carmax,1fh6qpnknu2l5802,5,Great jobs,SALES CONSULTANT,"Great jobs, great benefits, was there for three years. Left due to school otherwise i would still be there. You also have the ability to make more money "
Carmax,1fh5m03gat499802,3,Good benefits but pay could be better ,Customer Experience Specialist,Carmax is a good company. They offer numerous Benefits and management is very helpful. Some cons are having to use your on phones to make calls. They should offer some type of phone bill discount.
Carmax,1fh5jih8ru2l5800,5,Great place to get into detailing or for car lovers,Reconditioning Associate II,"If you want to get into detailing and cleaning cars, then this is the company for you. This is one of the best company I've worked at. My manager at Maplewood was always super nice. Currently, I am working at the Brooklyn Park store and the pay is very good for what we do."
Carmax,1fh1j7aceo2id802,5,Fun people but difficult to develop if you are in the wrong department,Inventory Associate,"Some of the people at CarMax make it easy to come in every day. If you are trying to get into a management or technician position, there is a lot of favoritism and the best people are not always promoted. Good as a transition job until you find your career."
Carmax,1fgnr2ns0o1e9802,4,Amazing people but pay was low,Business Office Associate,"I loved working at Carmax. The people are amazing and the environment was always fun. However, in the business office management allowed the people who worked hard to manage all the work while the lazy ones did nothing. They also gave promotions to lazy workers who did not know what they were doing. "
Carmax,1fgmnlg3un59l802,4,Autonomy to do your job,Sr. Sales Consultant,"Pay was excellent until commission was cut in half, but the company offers decent benefits, flexible scheduling, fun atmosphere, overall good co. Going through many changes for continued growth. If you like a fast paced environment, it's great. Company uniform requirements which can be beneficial..."
Carmax,1fgm8djfbs9sg800,4,Fast Paced Work Environment,Lead Business Office Associate,Fast paced and zero room for error. Working with customers from all over the map buying their first car is fun and exciting. Work/life balance is difficult to maintain as staffing is not congruent with workload at times. High turn over due to business being so busy that training is difficult. Fun team to work with makes long days easier. Miss out on a lot of family time though. 
Carmax,1fgkgkffrn59l800,3,Favoritism and Motivate you with lies,Inventory Associate,"Managers have leads and leads are associates with a bit more privilege but really try to take the managers role by telling others what to do and doing none of the work but still get commended for the great amount of work they do. You work in any weather, unless your a manager or lead. You get car max points instead of money bonuses. They make you work 10 hour shifts 5 days a week and consider it \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory overtime\xe2\x80\x9d and every department is sort of their own team. Sales dept is very demanding for their cars to be cleaned and moved. "
Carmax,1fgi7li4ou412800,1,Not a good place,Customer Service Specialist III,"Company boast they have you back...they absolutely do not have your back, infact management will toss a person under the bus quicker than anything.  If you enjoy gas lighting, this would be the place.  "
Carmax,1fg9v4fb6pi92802,4,If you hustle you have the potential to make a lot of money ,Automotive Sales Consultant,It\xe2\x80\x99s a great company with great benefits but the base pay for sales is only $2 more than minimum. Expect to be working constantly with no breaks or lunches (no time to slack off) to ensure your commissions. The top sales Consultants make well over 100k but unfortunately they basically live there and even go in on their days off. They cut the commission pay and can make as little as $40 for a deal. But coworkers become family and all are willing to help
Carmax,1fg886pe13kji000,3,"meh job, good short term but horrible for long term plans",Reconditioning Associate II,"I enjoyed the people i worked with, but your managers are nothing but puppets for the higher ups who are constantly walked on, and simultaneously do not prioritize their employees\xe2\x80\x99 well-being unless it affects them as well. Moving up or switching positions is almost impossible. You pretty much get stuck until people start quitting, but they will source new employees to fill those positions privately before officially opening the position for applications so no one can move up. decent money and not bad for a short term job but do not get stuck there forever, it will suck the life out of you. "
Carmax,1fg5dbo49hie4801,5,Unique place to work.,ASE Master Certified Automotive Technician,"Great company to work for, every associate is made to feel like they are part of the team and are put on a great training plan to help you grow. Lots of opportunities for growth weather you are a technician, detailer, in sales. "
Carmax,1fg4eu38pu428801,3,Could be better ,Sales Associate,The people are cool but the pay is the lowest I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen across dealerships. Set commission is super low and you have to basically be full time to see any money
Carmax,1fg2ksb6hsa1l802,3,Co workers ,Carmax,It was great working here. Only thing I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like was that there was some favoritism within our department. Which is seem a lot here. Other then that I my team was great
Carmax,1fg0mulrcs7mv800,4,Good company,Business Office Associate,"It was a good company with great benefits. 1 hour lunches with an optional 15 min break. Constant pay raises, free food sometimes, and safe work enviornment."
Carmax,1fg0c7rngo292802,5,I love CarMax's vision and drive to better themselves.,Sales Associate,I worked for CarMax for 5yrs and enjoyed the culture and people. Advancement is hard without relocating but still possible. CarMax is always trying to find a better way to serve its customers and I really appreciated that.
Carmax,1ffu2flh3hie4802,2,A living nightmare ,Customer Service Representative,Little to no support from most of the managers most of the time you get nonanswers when you ask for help. Training is so crammed that you have to revisit training modules and get made to feel less confident if staff finds out. They write observations nonstop and beat you down and very rarely acknowledge accomplishments and when they do it's some generic verbiage that feels forced. The culture is not how it's presented by the company at my location. Some days you won't even get a break and the overtime very rarely is worth it.. The turn over rate is extremely high because of these reasons.
Carmax,1ffrcppuco29h800,2,Pros and cons,Car Hauler,It\xe2\x80\x99s a great place to work if you are lazy. Lazy people get promoted and hard working people just get more and more demanded from them. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of drama and a lot of departments don\xe2\x80\x99t follow the CarMax standards and no one says anything. 
Carmax,1ffjtlsino292802,5,Great workplace,Business Office Associate,"Carmax is a good place to work, especially if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a 1st job. Company cares for their employees and often promote from within as long as you do the work for it. "
Carmax,1ffimt2q7o292802,1,Expect to be micromanaged,Reconditioning Associate IV,"Either one of two shifts, super early shift or super late shift - production doesn't have a choice other than those two. Training is somewhat good, however you're expected to pick up on training right away and witnessed more than a couple times people get thrown under the bus. Management starts off acting like they have your best interest at heart, before the corrective actions and discipline demoralizes you. They don't let off if you make a mistake. The hardest part of this job was finding cars on a 500+ car lot, and with no support from management you're on your own to make it happen. Witnessed awful covid procedures that did not protect customers in any way. Managers expecting the best production numbers every week when variables throw everything into disarray. Customer cars with awful quality standards that shouldn't be on the road, much less on the front lot."
Carmax,1ffimlt9do29h802,5,Great fun environment ,Reconditioning Associate iv,I loved working for this place they are a great company pays very very well takes care of their employees and puts a lot of effort into training and building up the employees 
Carmax,1ffie12jbhie4800,2,Use to be a great place to work,Parts Associate,I worked for them for 7 years the last 2 this company has gone down hill big time. The big problem is they get new managers every 1 to 2 years which they have no idea what they are doing. It makes a difference in a work place when you get managers that know how to manage. Carmax seems to not care anymore about there workers just like many corporations..
Carmax,1ffdmnn99t4pl802,3,Management is losing it,Cross Functional Store Manager,Work hard\xe2\x80\xa6 average pay. Decent management\xe2\x80\xa6 depends on store\xe2\x80\xa6 slowly getting worse\xe2\x80\xa6 indeed wanted more characters but this is a great company. Slowly getting after for promotions and less about the people
Carmax,1ffas4vb2t4ep800,5,"Challenging work, Great Environment",Sr. Business Systems Analyst,Excellent place to grow. Great work / life balance. Fast paced work environment with great team fun mixed in. This is filler to meet the minimum word count for the review. 
Carmax,1ff822ftlt4ep802,5,A good company with a fantastic company life.,Production Technician,"Although my employment was brief, I enjoyed much of it. While the company expects much of its employees, what the company does for its employees is just as well. Many days thought the year they offer catering from many places along with events and celebrations on the holidays. They even offer compensation if you offer assistance to the company by cleaning up after disasters."
Carmax,1ff63que9u3a4802,2,Managers are full of drama and only promote people who they like most. ,Business Office Associate,"The managers are all about drama, they fire any one who has a mind of their own, and they only promote associates who they show favoritism to. Overall carmax is one of the worst companies to work for. "
Carmax,1ff6307jtu3a4800,1,Management was ran terribly and all work was overloaded on the lower ranks,Mechanical Associate,"Unless you already have automotive certifications I would stay away from the mechanical side of Carmax. All work is pushed heavily on the lower ranked individuals. No matter how hard you work or how much production you push out it\xe2\x80\x99s never enough for the company. We worked double overtime working 2AM to 3PM for 11 weeks straight on 3 separate occasions to increase production yet we were understaffed in positions and the company REFUSED to hire more employees in crucial positions to relief the work load on others. I might have just had a bad experience as I joined a month before COVID 19 started so i know it was stressful times for everyone including the company. Also, the inventory side of Carmax currently is ran by horrid management. I would never recommend any one apply for a position at the Huntsville AL Carmax on the inventory side of work from looking on the outside seeing how certain workers were treated. The inventory manager constantly ran around without a mask during the peak of COVID but would threaten to write up employees if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a mask on or if it was below their nose.  "
Carmax,1ff4qrda6t4ep802,4,Fun but gets repetive,Lead Inventory Associate,"Super fun, you really get to know the people that work there, I worked there for a good bit, they even work with your schedule, but eventually, you just get tired of doing the same thing over and over. The weather also gets to you after a while."
Carmax,1ff2vsmu9t4e2802,4,Overall Great Place to work,Assistant Manager,"There is always something new to learn, no days are the same, great co workers and managers.  We all want to do our best and help each other out.  There are multiple shift"
Carmax,1ff2anjd8u33u802,4,Can make decent money if you come in ready to bust a**. ,Detailer,Job is ok for what it is. The pay is decent. You have to kill yourself to make money since it is commission based. You can have a great day of making money one day then lose money the next day with trashed cars that take very long to detail.
Carmax,1ff1uvqomu33u802,4,Learned new things,Sales Consultant,Great place to work if you can put up with a bunch of younger generation mentality. Management has a tendency to micromanage in areas they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Other than that you make it your own. 
Carmax,1ff0e0hvvu33u802,3,Decent money but managers only care about budget,Sales Associate,Managers always preach to ask them questions and partner with them in tough spots but any time you do that they seem bothered by it and basically make you handle the situation. 
Carmax,1feuhtpitu33u801,5,excellent sales job,Sales Consultant,excellent sales job with the opportunity to make endless amounts of salary with hard work and dedication; great training and management support to make sure you succeed in your position; great inventory and competitive financing options.
Carmax,1fesbtfhju33u801,4,Fun workplace,Inventory Associate,The entire team is welcoming and friendly. Every department gets along with one another and is extremely helpful. Good management and decent pay. Flexible hours provided and room for advancement when initiative is shown. 
Carmax,1feq6uf7uu3a4802,2,"Decent Pay, but don’t drink the Kool-aid",Customer Experience Assistant II,"Pay is on a sliding scale, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get started out at first. Once you get the hang of things you can make GREAT money. However, management nor anybody else has worked out the kinks of the system. Be prepared to be frustrated. If you\xe2\x80\x99re lucky enough to get a good manager, they will try their best to help but 75% of them have never sold a car before or worked for carmax more than a couple years. Typical office politics hidden behind a mission they don\xe2\x80\x99t live up to. "
Carmax,1fepmaqoit4ep801,4,Good Place of Employment ,Customer Service Representative,Working for CarMax Auto Finance in the beginning was enjoyable. The work is clear and the training wasn't difficult. You are given a lot of resources to be able to effectively do your job. I don't personally feel like the role suited me and how I like to help people. I felt like the quality of work I was provided was over looked due to a metric score not being at a certain percentage. I've never been the kind of person that would compare myself to a peer; but I started to do that here due to my work ethic being overlooked and saw that a lot of other people were just skating by not putting in the hard work like I was. The job can become discouraging when you know the quality of work you're bringing to the table. My manager and team lead were very supportive and encouraged me everyday. 
Carmax,1feomf5h4u33u801,2,The Inventory department is the easiest and most productive department ,Personal Info Inventory Lead/Service Consultant,"When I first began, it was a great place to work and the management staff at the time made sure all the benefits that the company offered, were seen and put to use. But after the company expanded, they begin to loose that family feel and perks began to disappear and they input more cut throat management and that made a huge shift in company and store level moral and it didn't feel secure to work there anymore. Plus attempting to advance as a person of color and a woman, was incredibly difficult."
Carmax,1fen1jm4nu33u801,1,alright but not the best,Parts Technician,"this job was alright, nothing I would go back to. Overall it wasn't a bad experience. Pay was not worth the work load.                                       "
Carmax,1femsmefvu3a4801,4,Company cares,Associate,"The work is quite stressful at times with constant change as a result of company taking a very reactive vs proactive approach to most situations. This can be frustrating not only because of the changing priorities but also often seeing lingering issues for months with no resolutions until it blows up. I sometimes question the decision making of some leaders and which initiatives they decide to pursue, but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to please everyone in a large company.On a positive note, CarMax actually does care about their associates. When furloughed due to COVID, my health care was covered and I was given additional paychecks, senior managers took pay cuts, and ultimately I was called back to work as soon as they could, as were many others. Was laid off in the past at another company, so was looking for stability and CarMax certainly has it. There\xe2\x80\x99s so much growth and management takes the time to develop you, as long as you take the initiative to push the conversation. Overall, I\xe2\x80\x99m satisfied with working at CarMax and would recommend it to others looking for a career."
Carmax,1fekqqe99u3a4801,4,Fun place to work pretty good pay ,Recon associate ,"Pay was pretty good, the job can get repetitive but overall people were cool it was a fun job. Early hours weren\xe2\x80\x99t the best for me. I found it hard to move up in pay without pushing the management."
Carmax,1fek0cv0ft4e2800,4,Great way to start in the car industry,Sales Trainer,"Carmax is know for there selling process, which is proven. As a sales rep you will not haggle and it is very easy to sell cars. Only things to take in to account, favoritism. If you have been there for a while, you get the sales. Everyone else gets appraisals, to possibly sell. "
Carmax,1fejsgdatt4ep802,1,Empty promises on top of extremely long work hours and unfair pay,Reconditioning Associate,Long days and nights working from 4pm-2am! Management makes empty promises about advancement and then nitpicks every little thing and uses that as a reason to not follow through on the promise. Unrealistic fleet targets and hard labor. Not worth it at all. 
Carmax,1fejjru1h308t002,4,Collections,Collections Specialist,It was hard to meet the goal sometimes. Some customers weren't able to pay or would even pick up the phone. Worked from home so that was great. My manager at the time wasn't supportive so ended up leaving. 
Carmax,1feim9mo0u33u800,4,Could be better without certain managers,Sales Consultant,"My manager plays favorites and threatens to fire me every day instead of giving me constructive criticism. Most of the people are nice, but I need a secure job so I can pay my bills on time."
Carmax,1fehjf7b1u3a4802,4,Good place to work although stressful ,Floor sales consultant,"Carmax is a great place to start a career in sales, their training program is pretty good at getting you up to speed, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cover enough of the idiosyncrasies involved in day to day activities and can leave you feeling lost. Staff and management are friendly and do try to work with you if life happens or if you are just looking to improve. Pay is good starting out and you can make more on commission on average. Commission is not as much compared to traditional dealerships but the foot traffic makes up for it. The biggest drawback to working with Carmax is how any interaction a customer makes with a call center or online before coming to the store will instantly half your commission. You could help a customer through the entire process of finding,financing, and purchasing a vehicle taking up a good chunk of your day only to find out it is a half deal because they called in to find store hours. Another major draw back is the clunky and outdated systems in place that cause bottlenecks in your workflow and causing the customers to wait even longer."
Carmax,1fefttlcvu3a4802,3,"Straight forward job initiatives, highly stressful, poor work life balance",Sales Manager,"Typical day working customer service issues and finding solutions. I learned working as team is very important to accomplishing a heavy workload. Management is overall effective but inconsistent from manager to the next. Culture is good but many changes, so constant change management is the name of the game. Most enjoyable part is working with a lot of good people."
Carmax,1feeu0k12t4ep800,5,Great place to work!,Customer Consultant,"Management is exceptional. My fellow employees are great and help you out if needed. Not the usual favoritism from managers, everyone is treated fairly."
Carmax,1feer8bv4o221800,5,Laid Back and Encouraging Atmosphere,Sales Associate,"I got to relax and make money on my own time, go at my own pace, and help people. There were days I just chilled and sold one car and there were days where I made a goal to sell 3 for the day and got after it and achieved that goal. "
Carmax,1feeq2h45u33u802,1,Terrible workplace the place is a joke,Inventory,If you are a hard worker and like to get in trouble for the smallest of things its for you. If you are lazy and don't do nothing but like to get away with everything then this place is also for you
Carmax,1fed68m5go1ir801,4,Not Great Not Terrible,Reconditioning Associate,Quality of daily experience highly dependent on who you supervisor is. Can earn some decent pay but climbing the ladder is the only way to make serious bucks.
Carmax,1fec4uu5ct4d3801,5,Strong Company Dedicated To Its Associates,Line Production Manager,"Management in your location sets the tone for the environment. With that said, the team at the location I\xe2\x80\x99m currently at does a great job. The company also recently increased wages to a level that makes it hard to compete with in retail. Granted a lot of the higher paying positions are skilled positions, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of room to grow and learn those skills. The benefits are some of the best in comparison to most large companies and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to not be positive about the company as a whole. "
Carmax,1fe8mjiaju38h802,4,"Organized, Structured, Company provides learning tools and staff to help employees succeed in their department",Service Consultant,"The CarMax service advisor position is a busy one. Be prepared to manage customers, automotive technicians, current and new repairs, walk ins, and phone calls from the moment the service aisle doors roll up to clock out time.  The company provides on the job training to prepare their employees to succeed in their roles and the management does care about every employee's success and well-being."
Carmax,1fe6rb3l1t4dh800,3,Plan to be there 24/7. ,Customer Service Representative/ Sales Rep,"You have to do alittle of everything which is cool.. but you basically live there. Super late nights, you have to request time off 6 weeks in advance and it seems like you get punished when you do more work. The plus side, the pay was pretty good, most of the managers are understanding. "
Carmax,1fe2ngf2it4dh802,2,"Mostly bad, atleast at the lower level. Not worth the time and effort you put in. Severely underpaid for the amount of work that is expected. ",Inventory,"Physically and Mentally demanding on a daily basis. Upper management is a joke, expect more than Is reasonably attainable, not aware of the reality of how things work at the lower level. Staffing is a joke, and they seem oblivious as to why. If you\'re actually a hard worker you will be used and abused. They say ""Carmax Cares"", but I never experienced that first hand. "
Carmax,1fe0cufggt4dh802,4,"Work Hard, Play Hard",Sales Consultant,"In Sales you get what you work for, if you work hard you will see the results. There is a new pay structure and that has affected pay since they do have the call center involved in the pay for commission now."
Carmax,1fdvlsq2rpi24801,5,good learning experiences ,Senior Sales Consultant,"its sales and can be dog eat dog,  carmax is somewhat better than most. carmax is not perfect but nothing is. some consultants  are just better than others. "

Carmax,1fdphs4rdt4dh800,5,Great job ,Reconditioning Associate,My experience with CarMax might differ from others. The work environment is great. The managers are great that\xe2\x80\x99s my experience working at CarMax. Just come in with a good mindset and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be alright. But ofc management can make or break a job for anyone. But over all here at my location everyone\xe2\x80\x99s happy. 
Carmax,1fdo63d1ksa4h802,2,Promises that are later proven to be lies...,Cross Functional Customers Specialist,"The company will tell you all these great things to hype you up in the beginning, but after a couple of years on the job, I can definitely say that it's all a gimmick. Once you get in the door, it's all favoritism and micromanaging on a ridiculous level. You get reprimanded for every little thing you do even sightly wrong, and you RARELY get any appreciation for working your butt off. The hours can be long, and the work can be physically and mentally exhausting, but that's not a big deal to me. I enjoy working hard, I just don't enjoy feeling like my hard work goes unrecognized, and the fact that the people who don't work but are buddies with management get promoted, while the hard workers get dragged through the mud and told to do better..."
Carmax,1fdn604r2sa4h801,5,"Absolutely a great company, great management, great team effort!",Customer Service Representative,"Fast paced, so your days go quickly, you learn a lot because you are cross-trained to fill many positions. Great pay, because it is salary and bonuses. The employees are so helpful because it is a true team effort for the company to be the best! I can't say enough good things about the company. Due to medical issues, I had to leave, and they were willing to accommodate me but I felt it was not fair to the other employees."
Carmax,1fdjoenklu23m800,4,Great career to pursue,Mechanical Associate,"Here you can work 8-10 hour shifts depending on demand, and over time is actually prevalent it gets a little rough seeing how no matter what shift you worked they were odd hours. But the pay makes up for everything."
Carmax,1fdhtk22nu23m802,1,Used to be a good place to work.,Mechanical Associate V,"Operations Manager, Line Production Manager, and the MA Lead have an immature process of managing their team.  They\xe2\x80\x99re childish and petty. It makes for a very stressful, hostile work environment that I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I\xe2\x80\x99m no longer a part of.  It\xe2\x80\x99s a good place to work if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind being micromanaged and treated unfairly. "
Carmax,1fdgp5lkbsa4h802,1,"Carmax, where you REALLY want to work?",Reconditioning Associate II,"My experience with Carmax.....the pay and benefits were there, more so the benefits, but you're basically their slave. No home life, worked like a dog and promises upon promises that are never given to you just told to you to keep you working and hoping for change. The people that you work with basically become your family because you're literally there 5 days a week, not to mention when you're on MANDATORY overtime....say goodbye to your life! Management doesn't listen to your concerns because their too worried about getting THEIR numbers for THEIR bonuses and they will take one persons word over another persons in a heartbeat, no questions asked!!! Also, have a very high employee turnover rate. THINK TWICE ABOUT IT BEFORE APPLYING!"
Carmax,1fdfpj755u29d800,4,Descent place to work if you are satisfied with little pay,Sales Consultant ,"Been working here for about 6 months and one thing is very clear.  If your client has worked with someone online from the corporate office you will be losing half of your pay.   Mini deals are only $160 and if your clients came in from online as 80% of them will that makes your pay go down to $80.  If you sell the extended service contract you get another $100 but again that goes down to $50 if your customer is an online customer.   You also get $50 if you do an appraisal and your client sells to the business office.  If they trade that car in you don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything.  If you are willing to work 24/7 you may be able to push $4,000 plus in a month.   However, you will get demolished in taxes!  "
Carmax,1fdfgv0mcu23m800,4,Productive and fast paced.,Detail Technician,"fun and great gig but like any job you will eventually find a manager that ruins the love for the job, given majority of managers are not like that it's all about luck. other than the dice roll of management working at Carmax has been a dream.

You can make good money if the person came on off the street and had done no prior activity online. In this day an age the majority of people do research etc. online before making a purchase. Just fearful that as the months go on commission will be less and less. 
Carmax,1fdakbebdu37o802,2,Job if you are desperate. ,Buyer,"They provide quality trainnning but the job was very cut throat. I was a buyer, the hours were bad, managers are bad and no one cares about you. Just another number."
Carmax,1fd8dfb8thihf801,3,Great Place to work ,Sales Consultant,Carmax provided an exceptional training program.  Being that I was new to sales I ended my first week averaging 6 sales. The work environment is very fast paced which can be a good thing because it\xe2\x80\x99s driving business. 
Carmax,1fd7n5eoms9u9800,5,Fast paced production ,Autobody painter,"Great job and job security and good Healthcare. Fast paced work environment with little stress. Poor work life balance, was on second shift and needed to work on first shift due to health concerns but was denied."
Carmax,1fd54jq0docao800,1,Over worked poor pay run people to the ground.,Retail Manager/Car Buyer,"If people what a job that\xe2\x80\x99s going to steal your life away go ahead and apply. Plus salary is not good at all.  No work life balance, the company says they like giving time off but it\xe2\x80\x99s not ok with management."
Carmax,1fd3nlpj2308h000,4,High pace but overall exciting environment,Vehicle Condition Assessor,"High pace workflow most days. The pay is low and needs to be better given the amount of work that is expected of you. The opportunity for advancement is dim, so it's an ok job to get by or while In school; however, career wise you'll have to be open to relocating states in order to advance. "
Carmax,1fd3an8m43h80002,1,Terrible place to work. Underpaid and overworked ,Customer Experience Associate,"Working at Carmax presented with its own difficulties. Management switched every 2-3 months. Safety is not their top priority, concerns and questions are not addressed accordingly, instead you are bullied into losing your job if you can\xe2\x80\x99t find away to adjust to their standards and rules. You are overworked and underpaid! Hours are terrible and your mental health is constantly on the line! This is not the customer service job you would want to enter! "
Carmax,1fd1q18pdhimt802,5,Pretty good overall,Sales Associate,"Good job overall to get into sales , I do not feel like the public is quite enough. Staff is pretty good to work with overall and everyone is pretty helpful "
Carmax,1fd1i3fljhihf802,5,Great place to work but ,Parts Specialist,Nice people to work with but management has us stretch thin sometimes have us doing other departments work due to management not in forcing good work ethic 
Carmax,1fctqrsoiocao802,5,Productive and fun workplace ,Senior Sales Consultant,"Amazing place to work, just like any job the more you put into it the more you will get out of it but I have loved my time with the company! This job will teach you how to overcome objections and be great at what you do! "
Carmax,1fctj5oi6hihf800,3,Not a bad place to work,Sales Manager,"Management seems to only care about the goals set by the company and making themselves look good. The pretend to care about the emplyees, but usualy don't back it up."
Carmax,1fcrhei7d308h000,5,Great Place to Work,Sales,"Great environment, that rewards for good performance.  Wouldn't change it for the world.  Integrity and ability to provide an iconic experience to customers.  Enjoy going to work everyday."
Carmax,1fcq61tn8s9u9800,4,Amazing work place ,Detailer,Probably the best job i have ever had but the down side is that i had a manager that was out to get me and he ended up getting fired a month after me and a couple other detailers left because of him
Carmax,1fcpeaamqhihf801,5,Laidback but can be slow,Service Advisor,"Once the Call center were brought online in 2020, the sales consultants received a 50% pay cut on their commission for every customer that calls the store-even if it is only to make an appointment. Same work for half the commission. Managers can bend the rules to help out their favorites. Favorites get post it notes with leads to call while the others just have to wait in line to take a customer,When not making enough money for a pay period to cover the insurance etc, you will get paid under 8$ per worked hour that you have to pay back next pay period.Even if you work 12 hour days 2 or 3 days in a row, you are not allowed to come in late or leave early on a quiet day. When scheduled morning shifts you often just sit around and stare out of the window (sometimes for hours) until it is your turn to go to the greeting point.Very high sales consultant turnover. Once you are done with training you are on your own. Health insurance is nice. "
Carmax,1fco5vsa5himt800,3,It’s an okay place,Business Office Associate,"Inventory and the Business Office are probably the worse departments due to the non advancement opportunities. Management isn\xe2\x80\x99t the greatest, but your co workers are probably the reason people stay. "
Carmax,1fcnk320n308h000,2,Under paid but the employees are great,Sales Associate -President's Club,Former Sales Associate Tons of favoritism- pay is $40-360 per car sale no matter the price of the car. Poor management no coaching quick to admonish you in front of customers.
Carmax,1fckbsckuu4nb802,1,Don't care about the employees anymore.,Sales Consultant,Changed CEO a couple years ago. The new one came in. Started taking away benefits. Cut commissions by half. No longer care about the partners. The quality of the vehicles and the service to the customers have diminished drastically.
Carmax,1fck9c8k7nq31802,4,Great place to work for entry level and mid career alike.,Fleet Driver,"Great company to work for. Company often goes above and beyond to take care of its associates. Many perks and benefits within the company. Great start for any entry level worker, working here can potentially be a great stepping stone to an outstanding career in or out of the automotive industry. The compensation is competitive. "
Carmax,1fck7sp45u4nb802,3,Not to bad,RA,"Company is ok to work for, you build used cars.  Benefits are really good. Hours you work are not the best. They have definitely changed over the years on value of associates, not in a good way. If you need a job, try it out"

Carmax,1fcdu3ulmu4nb801,1,Beware!,MANAGER,This is not a good company to work for. The favoritism is real! You will only go so far. There is no real opportunity for advancement unless you are a pet.
Carmax,1fcbmapgau4nb801,2,Work,Inventory,"A typical day in inventory was ok, depending on the weather.  There isn't much room for advancement.   There had been associates working as an inventory associate trying to be a Lead for 3 + years.  Leads are only paid a buck more.  "
Carmax,1fca444o0t57n802,3,Oh carmax,Detailer,Horrible communication. Production teams never worked together. Overall bad experience besides the team. Managers gad favorites and it showed on the line.
Carmax,1fc7cmvaon51g801,4,Great training and co-workers,Sales Associate,CarMax has one of the best employee and salespeople training available. The management really listens to employees and coworkers are always ready to step in to help you.
Carmax,1fc7a9u64n51g802,1,Company has alot to learn about paying people equally,Manager,"If you worked your way up from an entry level position to a management position or a salaried position, and don\xe2\x80\x99t have a college degree, you\xe2\x80\x99re paid less than a new hire with a college degree in the same position. Often times the difference exceeds $10,000. But you are held to the same standards, and if you have been in the position/company longer you are held to a higher standard. CarMax doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see anything wrong with this practice."
Carmax,1fc4jhsbqt57n802,2,Learn a lot,Reconditioning Technician,Good balance of hours. No weekends. Management is very strict. Can\xe2\x80\x99t be one minute late or they will coach you. Pay is terrible. They try to spoil you with dinners. 
Carmax,1fc48t7kdqelk801,3,Good starting company,Service Advisor,"It\xe2\x80\x99s a good step to get your foot in the door if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking to join the automotive service industry. The pay plan is not great, but it will allow you to get the experience you need to find a higher paying dealership. "
Carmax,1fc12ap15n51g801,1,Sales rep,Sales,Stressful having to meet so many requirements while working. Management always seems to micromanage everything you do. You can not leave for split second without them calling a meeting. 
Carmax,1fc0a65l1u4f3802,4,"Fun, always something new, helpful co-workers",Sales Associate,"Great place to work as far as the culture and management. Have to be self driven to excel though you are given the tools to succeed. Breaks were fair and benefits were good. Just be ready to take calls away from work if you're determined to succeed. Finally, prepare yourself for months with less customer interaction (Less sales), especially in the dead of winter."
Carmax,1fbujb0edn51g801,3,They’re great people to work with it’s just…,Customer Experience Consultant,They\xe2\x80\x99re great people to work with it\xe2\x80\x99s just that the systems we use aren\xe2\x80\x99t always working properly. They\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do a lot right now to keep up with competition and sometimes that backfires or they have to backtrack something (like we no longer offer test drives on home deliveries) and they don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly explain it to us until we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to set one up for our customers. Little things like that can just be annoying but I will say there are plenty job opportunities and it\xe2\x80\x99s not a terrible company to work for at all. 
Carmax,1fbtdj5md3kkq000,1,Company has changed and NOT for the better!,Floor Sales Consultant,"Turnover rate at Carmax has increased significantly and it's because employees are doing more on the job than they were doing before COVID while getting paid less. Company stock doing very well, but employee compensation has proportionately decreased with the overall performance of the company. Departments don't work well together and lack of competent leadership. Also- some managers are racist... literally had to report business office manager for unfair treatment of colored employees. Anyways... don't work here if you want to keep your sanity. Tootles!"
Carmax,1fbrr94bupib1802,2,Look Elsewhere ,Associate,"You are just a number and they only care when you're not there because management has to leave their office and actually help, which they don't do. Training was a joke. I was trained for four days on their systems and turned loose. The pay is abysmal for the work load and responsibility you're handed. Management is petty and truly uncaring to anyone's needs other than their own. People are not held accountable for anything and management will always do what's easiest for them. The only plus side is certain positions are Monday through Friday and there's really no one bothering you unless they want something. Also, their benefits package is a joke. Health insurance is extremely high ($350? Each paycheck), the vision is very limited in the providers in their network,  and the employee assistance program consists of a telephone number so you can share your feelings with, what sounds like a temp with a bad attitude. "
Carmax,1fbrmv5tbu4f3801,5,Fun to work allows you to learn ,Reconditioning Associate II,Carmax as a company is awesome carmax where I live is a joke management takes sides never gets the whole story fires ppl for things that others do hires ppl who don't know the job 
Carmax,1fbq1u9cipib1800,2,They overwork you. No consecutive days off.,Vehicle Condition Assessor,Pretty lame place to work. No room to grow. you'll get written up for anything. They honestly shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be on the forbes best place to work I wonder who they paid to be on that. 
Carmax,1fbpe8g58n51g802,3,Great environment,Reconditioning Associate,"The environment at CarMax is great! The jobs are fairly simple and other than weather issues it's pretty fun working there. THAT BEING SAID, some of their departments are grossly underpaid considering the amount and type of work they do. I do not recommend applying into the inventory department whatsoever as you generally start at $14 and other than an annual $0.15 raise there's almost no opportunity to grow in your role or to get raises. (And you can learn/grow all you want but they won't give you the title you're doing the work for OR pay you based on that work) They don't promote/give raises based on meritt and performance, they give them based on wether or not they like how you speak and act. If you ask too many questions or God forbid try to innovate how they do their process, you will likely never go anywhere. The benefits are amazing if you can deal with potentially never growing in your role or getting more than the measly annual raises. Oh and the AMAZING $15 Christmas bonus \xf0\x9f\xa4\xa3"
Carmax,1fbn21hp0sa24801,3,Stays busy but doesn’t leave much work life balance ,Sales Consultant,Very fast paced and established environment. Easy to succeed if you are willing to not have a life outside of there. Schedule is terrible and has you closing most of the days with only one weekend off every couple of months. 
Carmax,1fblkmb2433ie002,5,Great company to work for! Excellent company culture ,Buyer,"You walk around going \xe2\x80\x9care people always like this\xe2\x80\x9d and then you get hired and realize yes they are! The environment, company culture is amazing. Plenty of opportunities if your open to travel"
Carmax,1fblhge49u471800,2,CEO and upper management are slime balls ,Sales Consultant,"The best thing about working as a sales consultant for carmax is the relationships you grow with coworkers and customers. Unfortunately though, Carmax does not compensate its sales consultants fairly. If any potential customer does any sort of activity from the main website Carmax will split the sales consultants commission in half and claim that the sale was generated remotely. This deeply affects the sales consultants earnings because of course you are going to look online before just going somewhere and taking a gamble. The sales consultants are paid 100% commission and this is a very slimy way to take $ from their hardest working individuals in the company. The health benefits are below average. The work/life balance is absolutely terrible. Say goodbye to your friends and families because working for the weekend is going to be your new motto."
Carmax,1fbkmn2bet4hr800,4,Workflow and customer service,Vehicle Condition Assessor,I've been working with Carmax for 5 years now in the Purchasing department. There is always work to be done and the pay is pretty competitive. My managers and coworkers are dependable and we are pretty much friends both at and outside of work. 
Carmax,1fbkiutsr33ie000,2,Management prevents a positive environment and is the biggest impact to employee morale in the business office.,Management Assistant,"Business Office Management hinders positive environment, lacks basic communication, absenteeism and call outs are not enforced. Good workers are over tasked and run into the ground by lack of attendance enforcement. There is an extremely high turnover rate in the business office due to the incompetence of business office managers. There are some great people at CarMax Charleston and the work is not hard but management is the biggest impact to morale."
Carmax,1fbkg593dt4ui801,4,Good pay ,Mechanic,Has good pay and advancement good place to work there are strict rules management doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really appreciate you but that\xe2\x80\x99s about it for the bad they just need to get better management 
Carmax,1fbiiiqc8t4ui801,5,Excellent ,Sales Manager,Great opportunity to grow within the company. Training is up to 30 days with a plan to help you succeed as a sales consultant.                         
Carmax,1fbich42vo17o801,5,Great place to work,Reconditioning Associate level 3,The only thing I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like was some of my coworkers but that comes with every job so overall it was a great place to work.                           
Carmax,1fbi8g4o23o9s002,2,"Good place, bad pay. ",Detailer,"Good play, bad pay. Overtime for little pay, everyday is the same. Nothing changes. Expect the most out of you, but no motivation. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t handle Covid properly. Still allows ppl to work next to others. "
Carmax,1fbi2e50k3o9s000,1,No.,Inventory Specialist,CarMax is a good company. The staff and management for the most part is good too. The only thing I would say is that the pay isn't fair enough in some departments and me personally I don't feel appreciated as an employee half the time. Other than that CarMax is cool.
Carmax,1fbhe1ubpt4ui800,3,Decent job ,Reconditioning Associate,Good place to start your career in the automotive industry. I\xe2\x80\x99d you work hard you can get promoted quickly. There was a lot of favoritism but overall a good place to work 
Carmax,1fbdm890at4hl801,5,Always something to work on and keep busy ,Mechanical Associate,"Good pay and benefits, lots of potential for promotion within the company. Coworkers are very friendly as well as management. Carmax gives you a sense of belonging."
Carmax,1fbdiufs6s7nl801,1,Sh***y place to work,Sales Consultant (Presidents Club),No one gives a s**t about sales consultants. They add a bunch of extra work to your role b/c you\xe2\x80\x99re commission and they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay you for it. Every sale is a guaranteed split b/c if a customer even looks at a car online they consider it an online lead and only pay you half of your commission. You can make good money if you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to work 10-12 hour days 6 days a week.  
Carmax,1fb90nenbt4hl800,3,Enjoyed my time ,Sales Consultant,"I enjoyed my time at Carmax , my coworkers were all helpful and nice, the management could be a bit unhelpful especially when they want you to meet all of their goals even when the season is slow. Not enough pay my opinion for selling 10-20 cars a month.. "
Carmax,1fb8slphsn5bb801,3,Started out great but has gone downhill ,Sales Consultant,"Certain managers are very helpful and supportive but it\xe2\x80\x99s clear some may play favorites or help out depending on their mood for the day. Work life balance is pretty much non existent. It was tough to continue working knowing that new management was so terrible. If you end up in the business office just be wary of the manager, seems to play favorites and is a completely incompetent manager. Overall, I had a good experience. I met really great people and learned valuable skills that I still use today and had some great support from a few managers but ultimately, it just takes one bad manager to ruin the culture at work. If you can suck up to the right manager you may be able to move up within the company otherwise if not, you\xe2\x80\x99ll just end up overworked and underpaid with constant criticism from management. "
Carmax,1fb0a3rtau1ea802,2,"Terrible company to work for, pays the bills kind of job",Lead Business Office Associate,Terrible company to work for they have us doing our tasks along with managers tasks while they slack off roaming the store chatting with sales associates or disapear for over an hour with no knowledge of where they went. And when terminated wont even tell you why you were fired. Just tell you your fired and you have such amount of time to clear out your desk. Also have you working 1-3weeks straight with no days off. At times working 9am-9pm shifts. Show no appreciation for all your hard work.
Carmax,1fb0940b4u1ea800,3,It's not bad per se ,Customer Service Specialist II,"I enjoyed working for CarMax for the most part. It can be pretty stressful at times, but any sales job is going to have stress. It is a great place to work starting out in the car business, just because its not all commission based and you can learn the basics while working there.It can be stressful when there isn\'t someone that can help/ doesn\'t want to. And for growth within the company? You would have to be in their ""click"" and be their top favorite (in my personal and a lot of other people opinion). You get payed pretty decent, but you make basically nothing as you would at a traditional dealership would. "
Carmax,1favu7581t4lp802,4,Great Place to work if you enjoy a stable pay and career growth,Supervisor,"Worked for the CEC center in Norcross great group of people and great career opportunities , pay is stable and could make above average if you are a top performer ."
Carmax,1favpgvu0u2sn800,3,Management ,Sales Consultant,"it was ok working their just a lot of things could have been better.  like any sales jobs you have to move.  which was not a problem, but working with only one good Manager and the other two really needed better training.  "
Carmax,1faveq1adt4lp802,5,good place,Inventory Specialist,good place to be. works well with you lots of constant training programs to help you succeed. Lots of friendly people too help you meet your goals as well
Carmax,1fap1ri1it4lp800,2,A very selfish company ,Master Technician,Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about anything but numbers. You don\xe2\x80\x99t matter unless you\xe2\x80\x99re a manager. You get the feeling of communism. What you think or your ideas just don\xe2\x80\x99t matter because you are not a manager. 
Carmax,1fao4hd8cu2sn800,1,Inventory ,Inventory Associate,It was fun for the first month but then we got understaffed and also I feel like the CarMax slave who works outside and cleans cars. All of the other departments at this job will look down upon you because you are basically just a person who cleans their cars and organize their lot. Also you will not be provided any AC or Heat they expect you to survive in all weather conditions even a tornado storm. 
Carmax,1fanr2f1to25r800,2,Carefully consider before working here. ,Business Office Associate,"My time at Carmax was a mixed experience. I enjoyed my team and I felt there was at least some effort to be more inclusive/diverse. There is also job security,  there was no shortage of work even at every stage of the pandemic. There was also opportunities to learn new thing which I enjoy. There are multiple paths open for advancement if you are willing to sink some years into Carmax.Past that there are some issues; compensation is somewhat low with only recent flexibility because they are desperate for labor, the communication between management is poor, same between management and leads at times, they are forcing mandatory overtime in multiple departments for now 3 months, general store manager went on vacation during this time which was not very good for morale, they will ding you if you clock out 1 min early or clock in 1 min late, my benefits package was poor I went to the doctor only once my insurance covered 82 dollars of 300 rest was out of pocket. You are going to be overwhelmed with stress during peak times and so are your coworkers/leads which can strain team cohesion. You will be forced to pick between helping this customer with the time sensitive issue or the other customer's time sensitive issue due to a severe labor shortage, sometimes so busy that taking your breaks is impractical although they won't stop you from taking it. Forced to play secretary for the entire store and some times other stores. The CEC(Carmax's call centers) will regularly provide incorrect information to customers leading to terrible customer satisfaction or record information wrong which"
Carmax,1fammfko7u1ea802,3,Good place to work,Buyer's Assistant,"Great work environment unless you\xe2\x80\x99re looking to progress. They people you work with are great and helpful. However, I was promised a promotion for years and it just felt like a carrot being dangled at the end of a stick. "
Carmax,1fal725uuu1ea800,1,Beware,Vehicle Condition Assessor,It's an unfriendly place to work. The staff would talk to you and be nice but there was always an underlining fakeness.   Learned a lot and loved the job it's self.
Carmax,1fak6nb0dt4lp800,2,Long hours. Work every weekend and all holidays. Mediocre pay.,Floor Sales Consultant,"Working here was great for many years before Carmax established the Customer Experience Center - which you will have to split 50% of your commission money no matter if the CEC rep put in 2 minutes of work or actually spent time building an order for a customer. A customer can go to the website and click ""Hold Vehicle"" at a store, have zero contact with the CEC, and still you will lose 50% of your commission, all while spending the same amount of time or sometimes longer then with a fresh customer walking in the door. Most of the sales are consistently like this. So now you are putting in the same time and work hours with a customer, sometimes more because of the countless CEC errors, and getting paid half."
Carmax,1faj4ob8lu1ea801,3,Lots of hours for not a lot of money,Senior Service Consultant,You work a ton of hours but aren\xe2\x80\x99t really compensated fairly. There is also no advancement incentive within the position. Once you are a service consultant you will always be just a service consultant. They use to have a senior service consultant position that gave you a slight bump in your hourly rate but they did away with it. The only way to make more money is to write more service. 
Carmax,1fait21tpu1ea800,5,Mostly great coworkers,Inventory Control Specialist,"Be ready to work because there is more often than not alot waiting for you and if you have to deal with transporters good luck, most of them act as if they are doing you a huge favor delivering cars to you that they get paid well to do."
Carmax,1fah6pgch33ip001,5,Professional and fun environment,Sales Consultant,"I absolutely love this job. I never in a million years wanted a job in sales, but I'm so happy I took this position. The feedback culture is awesome; it is the perfect environment  to grow. The managers are supportive and my fellow sales consultants are ways willing to help. "
Carmax,1fah33m21sa6u802,3,Its just alright,Customer Service Representative,They definitely car about you as a person not a number but training doesnt explain to much of how to do your job and your thrown to the wolves with overly complicated systems 
Carmax,1fagnlvv0u1ea800,4,Not a bad starter job ,Detailer,"This job is okay but kind of a dead end. It will pay the bills though. Depending on how hard you work, your paycheck will reflect how much desire you have to detail cars. "
Carmax,1faglu8vgo25r800,4,Productive and fun. Detail oriented ,Detailer,Washed cars. Dealt with rude coworkers (sales). Depending on the day is how it went. As a detailer you get bossed around by people from the sales department and rushed because they get paid for commission
Carmax,1faciccbqu31c802,3,Was great at first,Mechanic,"First of all, I generally don\xe2\x80\x99t write reviews, good or bad, but I wanted to share my experience with anyone thinking of getting a job here. When I started here I was really excited about this place. I came from a shop where I worked long hours for commission and the workflow was very unsteady, so I was excited for consistent hours and hourly pay. They took care of their employees as best as they could during Covid and I still promoted within months. Base pay is good for whichever role you are in and the responsibilities you have in that role. Benefits are good with 401k match and they contribute to your HSA account yearly (if you have one). Fast forward to now and everything has changed. We have been in constant overtime since January, most weeks are 50 hour weeks, and the way managers talk it sounds like there\xe2\x80\x99s no end in sight. For two production shifts, the hours have been miserable on either shift (3:30am-2:30pm mornings and 3pm-2am nights). Production goals keep going up while staff are dropping like flies, making everybody work twice as hard. Overtime pay is good but not worth the stress and lack of a work/life balance. While we work like it\xe2\x80\x99s the last thing we\xe2\x80\x99ll ever do in life, it seems we are a little under-appreciated; hardly any recognition for going above and beyond (it generally gets you nowhere at this place, anyway). Management is always scrambling to meet goals and sometimes if you need a manager they\xe2\x80\x99re either nowhere to be found or too busy working on the line.   They do provide lunch, energy drinks, snacks, etc sometimes and generally don\xe2\x80\x99t give you too much"
Carmax,1fac98oman58g802,1,Toxic Environment/ Be Careful!!,CSA - Customer Service Associate,"I worked in the business office and started off as a BOA. Things did start off well, but they usually do. I was promoted to a CSAD, but did not receive a raise and was disregarded when I asked for one. The head management sucks; they are very harsh, unforgiving, and do not lead by example. The work environment was the worst aspect to me. There is no work/life balance. A typical day includes being forced into doing the work of 3 people because there is no one else there to do it. Every single person that works in the business office ends up stressed out to the point that it visibly shows. High stress, low reward. 0/10. I do not recommend!"
Carmax,1fa98o0k8hipq800,2,It was a job ,Business Office Associate,I would not even tell my worst enemy to work here. There is no balance for life honestly. Barely ever get 2 days in a row off and if you do you\xe2\x80\x99ll just end up working more consecutive shifts the following week. 
Carmax,1fa8hvnq8npjo801,4,Love the company hate the stores ,Customer Specialist III,"Working for carmax has its benefits, it\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful company. I was cross functional and was able to be trained in multiple departments making me more useful to the company. However, with the roll out of Omni we had more messes to clean and less commissions. We had high turnover at my location and new management was not settled in their roles at all."
Carmax,1fa78osfqn58g800,3,Overall good company,Reconditioning Associate II,Overall its a good company to work for. The work environment can sometimes be a lot to handle. The work hours vary depending on the demand of the company.
Carmax,1fa6c4q4as7ln800,1,Horrible leadership ,Sales Consultant,Constant turnover in all departments. Corporate goal is to pay people as little as possible in order to increase company profit. More experienced employees have left. 
Carmax,1fa596r8fnpkq801,4,Fun but stressful ,Sales Associate,Coworkers were great and had a lot   Great times! Pretty simple and straightforward goals but the micro management system mad everything harder than what it really was.
Carmax,1fa4e6k60hipq801,2,Great place to learn and then leave ,Detailer,"This job is a great job for teenagers. Great first job. If you\xe2\x80\x99re looking to break your back for $12/hr this is the spot! Horrible work environment. They preach \xe2\x80\x9ctogetherness\xe2\x80\x9d but will not will help you out at all. Some of personal tools vanished, Mangers played favorites. They want things done fast,  not correctly. Clean cars go to the senior detailer and gives the worst to the new employees. Beware. The best is the manger of the department has a list of primo cars for his favorites.  I was never \xe2\x80\x9cfriends\xe2\x80\x9d with all them so I only saw the list once or twice. Great training.  Scratches are hidden and painted Over, not a real \xe2\x80\x9cfix\xe2\x80\x9d. Enjoy the horrible Carmax experience and their miserable atmosphere. Hours are roughly  3:30am - 2:40pm Typical car dealership. They care about their numbers/profits and could care less about the customer or employees. You are just another number. Great place to learn, and then promptly leave. "
Carmax,1fa3fmoetn58g800,3,Productive ,Inventory Associate,"It\xe2\x80\x99s ok we are asked to work Saturdays now because of the demand of sales,coworkers are good people very productive, managers can be ok at times overall it\xe2\x80\x99s a good place to start "
Carmax,1fa39tkn2n58g801,3,Not a cutthroat environment like you would find at most dealerships.,Sales Consultant,"I was with the company for over 20 years and watched dramatic changes take place over the years. When I first started there were fewer than 10 stores in the company and it was a very close knit organization. Corporate management was able to visit the stores on a regular basis and knew most of the associates by name and were aware of what was happening in the stores. The changes that they would put in place due to these store visits were beneficial to the customers, the business and the employees. Today there are over 200 stores and there\xe2\x80\x99s no way that the corporate office can keep their \xe2\x80\x9cfinger on the pulse\xe2\x80\x9d of the business so they require management to do massive amounts of reporting. As a result, managers are graded on how well they pencil whip their reports and reviews and not on how well they manage the employees and the floor so most of the time when you need a manager to help you close a sale or gather documents for financing they are too busy on their computers to be able to help. It\xe2\x80\x99s a shame, but Carmax has gotten too big to be as effective as it once was.Also, apparently the company has decided that they have grown the business enough and are now looking for ways to squeeze every penny out of it that they can. As an example they recently built huge call centers. When a customer calls in with a question, they can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to a store directly - their call is routed to the call center instead. Consequently; they don\xe2\x80\x99t speak with an experienced Sales Consultant they speak with someone who is hired from outside the company strictly to work at the call center and the questions"
Carmax,1fa13517ds7io801,4,Really fast pace,DRA 2 PAINT DEPT.,"Excellent place to work if you can handle the speed and quality. Great benefits.  It really depends on the person, if you are willing to work really hard to advance in the many opportunities Carmax offer then this is for you, but if youre going to be one of those waiting on chances to fall down on your feet then this is not for you,  I worked my tail for 3 years and it was not easy but made it into the paint dept. Hrd work really pays bere at Carmax. "
Carmax,1fa114hifs7ln802,3,I appreciate the experience,Business Office Associate,"I currently work here as a business office associate and the job is solid. We complete title work, buy cars(appraisals) and sign deals of customers buying cars. The store i work for is nuts. We run deals well after closing. We could leave as late as 12am and our store closes at 9 and 8 on sundays. I mostly hate how my pronouns are not respected at work. I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten a name tag representing my pronouns but customers and employees still address me as she/her even after i explain the correct pronouns. It took about 2 months to even receive the name tag. It just hurts not being taken seriously at my job. Managers and employees are okay. I usually stick to getting my work done and getting out honestly. Pay is ok for the work we do but there could always be a raise in my opinion. "
Carmax,1fa10mkqlhipq802,1,Carmax,CSAD,"Always gossiping and very cliquey. Managers are pretty okay , but cliquey too. Business office is very choose favorites.  Company seems great overall, but could do better."
Carmax,1f9uhtl1nn58g800,3,The benefits like tuition reimbursement ,Lead Business Office Associate,The benefits are great but the pay is low. I worked there for 3 years and had a degree and others without a degree were promoted over me. Management clearly shows favoritism 
Carmax,1f9u42h5es7io802,3,Great culture...with the right manager.,Customer Experience Associate,"Great company and the home office was great. Depends on who your manager is. I was micromanaged to the point my health was deteriorating and was basically forced out. Great company, but the call center work can be too monotoneous. If you took longer than 4 minutes to go to the bathroom they will micromanage you as to why."
Carmax,1f9km26iohipq802,2,Long hours! Overworked and under paid ,Business Office Associate,I worked for carmax for 2 years! Not the best company to work for they underpay their employees and expect them to work ridiculous hours. No perks or rewards. 
Carmax,1f9k9ii6thipq802,3,Sales is changing,Sales Consultant,"After working for the company for three years, I have watched how they are moving the car buying experience to a more remote setting. The experience of purchasing a vehicle from a sales consultant is slowly, but surely, evolving into an online purchase that will be completed by an hourly associate. The commissioned associate is being robbed of sales and appraisal purchases because of new policies surrounding the rollout of their new customer experience centers (the ones who handle remote leads). Commissions are halved or unattainable due to remote leads and it will continue to dwindle over time. A long term investment in sales at CarMax is not one I would recommend. "
Carmax,1f9i80fminpkq802,4,Good place to move up,Inventory Associate,It is a good place to work if you want to continually move up and grow within the company. Several of the managers at my location have been there 20 plus years. 
Carmax,1f9i0unc4s7ln800,2,Cares more about money than anything else,Customer Experience Associate,"When I started at the CEC it was great and the balance between on calls and after call work was a great mix. However, now we have no time for notes nor can we even get a sip of water because the calls are back to back. Management cares more about your numbers than actually helping the customer and creating the iconic experience they shove down our throats. What happened to doing all we can for the customer? Now its, we cannot give you an answer to that or if the customer needs a store associate have them call back after they reached the CEC and held for an hour for us to pick up. No concern for the customer and no concern for well being of the associates"
Carmax,1f9fh9nofnpjo800,5,Good place to work,Reconditioning Associate II,"A fast paced environment to work, everyday there\xe2\x80\x99s always things to keep you busy which makes the day fly by! Enjoyed working there due to having great co workers , managers and leads were always there to help. Can get a little stressful at time but overall a good working environment. Good pay as well"
Carmax,1f9fdaat7npjo802,3,Was a great job at first,Automotive Detailer,"I have worked for CarMax for the last year and a half and it has been a somewhat rewarding experience but has not been entirely worth the amount of stress and sacrifices I have had to make while working there. The hours were good when I was working in inventory but then we became severely understaffed which put all of us into overtime that never seemed to end. 45+ hour weeks that extended for many months. Something that I enjoyed while working here was the advancement opportunities, but staffing always got in the way of moving up. It took me almost a year to get the opportunity to promote again, and no matter how hard you work chances are the manager will pick their favorite to move up over you. It has been nice because the overtime adds a nice amount to the paychecks but the stress is not worth it and the lack of a proper work-life balance is what is making me leave."
Carmax,1f9aoklhr3oid000,2,Do not work here!,Mechanical Associate,"Do not work at Carmax. You are just a number to them. They will write you up for anything. As a simple miss on the inspection line, will get you a write up. The time off request use to be okay. Since the change of the system, you are not going to get time off if someone else has it off. They work you to the bone and think nothing about it. It use to be a Monday-Friday job now they want you to work through Saturday. No work/life balance at all. When a promotion comes up you won't get it. The place acts like a huge popularly contest. Promote the bad worker and keep the good workers in there place. Its not worth the pay at all! "
Carmax,1f9ae02g7u4j2800,3,Kind of a dead end job.,Reconditioning Associate,"Starting on the cosmetic side. You start as a Reconditioning Associate. Typically scanning all the cars on the lot at the start or end of a shift, receiving cars off of transporter trucks, prepping customer cars and doing miscellaneous tasks. When you're there long enough, you'll be promoted to a RA1. As an RA1 you'll clean cars for the front lot. If for some reason you're still there, you'll eventually move up to RA2. There you'll do everything I just described but also inspect cars cosmetically. Normally this progression takes 6 months at a time. The reality is that once you're somewhere the company likes, you tend to stay there indefinitely. The turn over rate is higher than you'd think for this exact reason. It's a nice summer job, but after a while it gets very old. The work culture is laid back, but you need to stay busy.       "
Carmax,1f8sfinscs9vs800,5,Fun environment,Sales Consultant,"Opportunity for great potential for the right candidate. If you're willing to use their training and are open to learning new techniques, every day can be rewarding. "
Carmax,1f8r4u6h4npfe800,2,Was once great but not anymore, Sales consultant,"The company was a fun and vibrant place to work. However, due to restructuring, the company now feels tense and toxic. Commission has been restructured to the point where it no longer makes sense to work at the company. 100k annually to 45k annually. "
Carmax,1f8ooq3vuu3li800,4,Inventory Associate ,"Inventory Associate Houston, TX","Great people to work with. Management could use some work but over pretty decent. Pretty underpaid for all of the work that we do on a daily basis (receiving and shipping cars, prepping a staging inventory). Hardest part of the job is working in the Texas summer heat. Management could use work but overall a good place to work"
Carmax,1f8ngr3bus9u0800,4,Not bad,Sr Sales Consultant,"Not a bad place to work. You can be obligated to work overtime, but it's actually not required. You just lose money if you choose not to work overtime. The culture isn't bad, but you get in trouble for the smallest things"
Carmax,1f8n7t3cgu3li800,1,Non productive company.,Fleet driver,"Nothing to enjoy about this company, Nothing to learn, pour workplace culture,  management issues every day, they don't recognize any effort from employees. "
Carmax,1f8n7dhm23oer000,4,Great company to work for. Progressive and Happening,Sales Manager,Worked as Sales Manager for almost ten years. Fast paced dealership and plenty of room and support for advancement. Great place to learn people skills as you will be dealing with a lot of personalities.
Carmax,1f8n2mo6bs9u0800,4,"Some wonderful people, some terrible managers",GM,"As part of the management team I found that the disparity in the quality of the management personnel was at time shocking.  Depending on where the candidates came from they could either be exceptionally skilled and personable or barely able to complete a sentence.  But, overall the company and the workforce were pleasant and enjoyable to work with."
Carmax,1f8mm0tc3u3li800,5,Fun place to work ,Customer Service Representative,I enjoyed working here . It was fulfilling and fun . I had very easy going co workers which makes A big difference in this line of work . I would work here again 
Carmax,1f8m218mdnpuh800,3,The benefits and environment. ,"Customer Specialist, Alternative Delivery","CarMax provides great benefits for full time employees, including 401k match, dental,  medical, and vision. The environment is fast paced, and the day sometimes seems to fly by with how busy it can get. "
Carmax,1f8jaipbfs7ng800,1,Beware!!! Do not work here!!!!,Sales Associate,Do not... I repeat do not work here!!! They will lie about the pay and having your back and caring about you but at the end of the day they only care about their budget. They continually cut our pay and if there are any issues within the company they will pretend to listen and care but ultimately just make excuses. This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for.
Carmax,1f8ipgs0unpuh800,2,No place for talented people ,Ma5 mechanical associate ,"I worked there for 1.5 years, if you want to advance to any other position, they have majic questions to answer. I was passed up for a position that I had 20 years experience with, the guy that got the job had zero experience. He answered the magic questions better. Q's had nothing to do with the job, or your abilities. You could be the most qualified by far, with all the experience, all the knowledge.... they don't care, just answer the questions. Overtime got really old, you have no control or input on the hours you work. You are just a number to them, quit, they don't care, they will find someone else, with talent or not, they don't care. Used to be an amazing place to work, CEO changed and things quickly went downhill. Cutting positions to save money, work more overtime. Getting off work at 2am gets old. Or going to work at 4 am... that sucks too."
Carmax,1f8dn50e6npuh800,4,Great culture,Sales Manager,Room for advancement past a junior level manager is limited. They tend to bring in outside hires instead of promoting within at the senior level. You will work nights and weekends
Carmax,1f8dhurpmn5ed800,1,Grew a lot even with poor management ,Sales Associate,"I learned a lot at this job and grew a ton, regardless of the management being so poor. I felt as if they just gave up on me even though I was a hard worker."
Carmax,1f8br0c5sn5ei800,3,Pretty decent place to work ,Business Office Associate,"Very fast-paced and demanding job, but it usually depends on if you work at a busier, bigger location. The training was good and they provided a lot of practice before you handled customers by yourself. You will be required to learn A LOT of stuff in this position and need to be confident when going through paperwork with customers so be ready to learn. The pay is not that good and the job can be exhausting at times dealing with so many customers with different personalities. The best part about working here is getting to learn so much about the car buying and selling process. You'll be a pro on all things cars and won't really have to worry about getting hustled when you go looking to buy a car for yourself."
Carmax,1f8aslesfs7ng800,4,Overall a great company to work for,Service Assessor,"I loved working at Carmax , You feel like a family and everyone is great to work with. The pay is fair , and the benefits are okay. The only bad thing is working outside in all conditions, but thats apart of the job description . "
Carmax,1f8aos5his7ng800,5,Good place to work only sucks in the heat,Buyer's Assistant,Good place to work only sucks in the heat. Everyone is helpful and it is a good place to start or if still in school. Everyone is very friendly and has your best interest in mind
Carmax,1f89fcpv1npuh800,3,Mixed emotions,Customer Experience Associate,"Ehhhh It was okay to start , after time management seemed to get run thin , i barely speak to my manager commission is hard to understand and hourly rate should be increased "
Carmax,1f88pp9d9n5ed800,4,"Overall a decent job, good work environment, pay could be better.",Inventory Associate,"This was an overall \xe2\x80\x9cokay\xe2\x80\x9d job. The tasks they have you doing in inventory are repetitive, sometimes gross and exhausting, \xe2\x80\x9csomebody has to do it\xe2\x80\x9d type of jobs. It can be fun sometimes since you get to drive a bunch of different cars but the pay and benefits are not worth the constant exposure to the elements since you would be working outside all days of the year. Working here in the winter was miserably cold and wet. Working during the summer you\xe2\x80\x99re constantly sunburned and nearly passing out from heat exhaustion. It would be a good part time job or a temporary job but I would not recommend staying in inventory for long if you do decide to work at carmax."
Carmax,1f88jr6j4u42d800,3,Poor Management ,Lead Business Office Associate,Management is there to only look out for themselves and make budget daily to get their bonuses. Forced overtime and denied vacation and personal time off when needed.
Carmax,1f87a13tmnpmo800,5,"Great company, less than great pay",Business Office Associate,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time working with CarMax but for the efforts of the business office, the pay should be higher. There is an intense amount of work that goes through us but we are paid barely above minimum wage. I thought the pay was great prior to starting but it turned out to be a lot more responsibility than what they're paying us for. Overall, though, CarMax is an exceptional workplace and everyone is incredibly uplifting and considerate. If you're having a bad day they will understand and try to help you get through the day and check on you if you are out sick or if you are late (they will call and ask if you are okay instead of asking where you are)"
Carmax,1f8176g8lsa97800,5,"Productive and fun environment, face paced",Inventory Associate,"I worked there for about a year and a half and I must say the position is perfect for anyone who is in between school, in school, different jobs, or simply wants a straight forward position."
Carmax,1f80n4lnshihn800,1,very dull and monotonous work,Mechanical Associate,"You basically do the same thing over and over again each day, especially if you get stuck in Diag. There is also a problematic lead tech. Very petty, vindictive, and has the emotional maturity of a 14 year old.This a job of last resort. Carmax has a mantra (\xe2\x80\x9cCarmax is great place to work\xe2\x80\x9d). The opposite is the actual truth."
Carmax,1f7u55lsrsa97800,3,Pays well. Not all they make it out to be. ,Mechanical Associate,"I was hired as a Mechanical Associate 3 and made it to Mechanical Associate 5 very very quickly. This was during the time of major production changes on the horizon. CarMax pays very very well. Very well. You will work less hard and be paid very well hourly for it. Although, the work life balance isn't there. And the constant pep rallies and being treated as children is atrocious."
Carmax,1f7ti1qec3gtf000,5,Productive work with room to advance.,Driver,Work in the transportation department and it is a new department within the company. There is a lot of room for growth with very clear paths to follow in order to advance. However because the department is still growing it does take a little time for the next step to open up. 
Carmax,1f7rhek18u1m4800,2,Work hard but get paid peanuts ,Sales Associate,Good company to start learning how to sell cars if you don't mind getting punked for commissions. Around 300 per car sold if lead hasn't came from call center otherwise its 150
Carmax,1f7rglqt4u1m4800,4,Promotions available quickly,Inventory Associate,"As long as you put in the work in Inventory, you can get promoted quickly. Working there 8 months, and I've already been promoted twice. There's a great work environment and the managers truly help you get as far as you want to go. The only bad thing for some people is the amount of overtime January-July. "
Carmax,1f7pqh6e9u23e800,3,Great until they slashed all commission by 50%,Car Sales,"You sell a lot of cars.  You used to make about 300-350 per car ""if"" you sell the extended warranty.  If you don\'t its about 160 per car which is laughable.  Now they slashed all commissions by 50%.  So lets do the simple math.  If you go 20 for 20 meaning hitting all the extended warranties that is 20x160=3,200 bucks.   UMMMMM if you sell 20 cars you should make at least 6 grand.  Now if you don\'t hit all the extended warranties that number of 3,200 goes way down.  Yeah no thanks, I used to work there when the commissions were different and I made a ton of cash... Not so much now.Its a great job for a young kid, beware of the tattle tail environment of employee\'s.  I have never had sooo many complaints from staff ever its like a daycare.  I was the top 3 seller every month, I just couldn\'t take the greed of slashing commissions in half."
Carmax,1f7pa54ihu1fn800,5,Cool ,Call Center Representative,"Cool work place, I have no complaints except the temperature of you work inside the actual call center. Working from home gets a bit much, I would prefer to work in office "
Carmax,1f7p750qpt53t800,4,Great company. No work life balance ,Customer Experience Consultant,As a customer experience consultant you have no flexibility with your schedule. The job is stressful because it is customer service and sales combined.  Lots of unreasonable goals to meet.  Great company otherwise.  
Carmax,1f7p4kdaosa5g800,2,Mediocre ,Inventory Associate,Worked in Inventory. Management was poor and hired poor workers putting the load on the few good people there. Expected to do way more than you were paid for. Management only cares about numbers and nothing else. Make no effort to help associates grow and move into higher positions. Be a lazy kiss up and you will have no problem here. 
Carmax,1f7om9sn3t53t800,3,Decent pay ,Painter,"Decent pay and benefits, work and life balance ok. 401k. Management ok. No room for growth. Good health insurance and time off. High turnover rate. Overall decent job "
Carmax,1f7obfmt4u23e800,5,Great company,Sales Manager,"Awesome training, awesome tools, solid managers, growth opportunities. I am grateful for my 17 years with  CarMax. I learned so much. CarMax changed my life. "
Carmax,1f7n957tln52t800,5,Amazing,,"Amazing organization to be a part of from the aspect of culture, development, and future career growth. Amazing team environment with strong goals and incredible support. "
Carmax,1f7m6v88qn59q800,1,This is a JOB not a CAREER,Reconditioning Associate IV,"This was literally the worst job I've ever had. And I've had some bad ones. The managers micromanage, never listen to the employees and do the exact opposite of what the department needs. I worked in the inventory department at 6001 as an RA4 and this was the most disorganized cluster I've ever seen. I've tried my best to get things together but team work is at an all time low because morale is non-existent. The overtime has been outrageous with it being extended another 2 hours a day I til august 2021 subject to change. Alot of my coworkers myself included are leaving to find better opportunities and a company that supports you and appreciates it's employees. There is no work life balance and "
Carmax,1f7jshn2thirt800,5,Love my job!,Sales Representative,I really do love my job so much. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been with this company for over two years and have worked in two different departments. Everyone here works together and it is a company that I feel safe with. 
Carmax,1f7h3q9kbt3q7800,5,Es una empresa donde es un placer trabajar.Best place to work,Sales Consultant,Tremenda compa\xc3\xb1ia con buenos beneficios y un ambiente agradable de trabajo.
Carmax,1f7gq1f12u2ud800,4,They know how to boost employee morale. ,Sales Consultant,They take great care of their employees. Whether it's giving away TVs at the Christmas party or the countless free lunches. It was a great culture to be around. Unfortunately the money was just not there and as a sales consultant the money was very up and down. 
Carmax,1f7eoopj2o1nd800,1,"Worst company, full of favorites",Sales Representative,"Company does not even take the time to communicate with you. Management thinks they can bypass laws, and if they think you look at them funny will overlook your skills and what you bring to the table. Was not given any answer after reaching out to management and HR about my process until 1 year later. Yes 1 whole year later. "
Carmax,1f7cpt4s3u2ud800,4,Pretty Good College Job ,Sales Consultant,Worked here part time while in college. Really flexible schedule and the potential to earn a decent check if you can learn their techniques. Low pressure on customers to buy. 
Carmax,1f7aqmp79o20r800,3,WAS great,Sales Consultant,"The pay was great until they changed the business model and started OMNI. The people are still great, just overworked, stressed, and frustrated with all the changes."
Carmax,1f7a1det0t3q7800,5,Great,Senior Specialist,"CarMax is a great place to work in. The environment is awesome, and the people are great. I absolutely love their  tuition reimbursement program, and other several benefits."
Carmax,1f79dv94io1nd800,1,Very inconsistent values,Mechanical Associate I,"This location doesn\'t care about previous experience, knowledge, or qualifications. I applied as a detailer but was hired as an inventory associate instead. I had over three years of previous detailing experience. I eventually became a ""mechanical associate"" at the entry level when a position opened up. When I started, I was already a current ASE-certified master technician (CarMax did nothing to help with my advancement). I tried to show that I was knowledgeable and wanted to be moved up ASAP, but it appears to me that management held me back on purpose, maybe because they were intimidated or prejudicial. I tried to be an advocate for quality, but they treated me like I was demanding too much. This company deceives customers by claiming they have the best quality, but they really just put anything out on the lot to make profits. I was constantly targeted for taking too long to do jobs, despite the fact that I stayed busy at all times. They expect a combined oil change and emissions test in 19 minutes, which just isn\'t a realistic figure. Almost all inspections and checks must be done in that time as well. I couldn\'t take the continuous badgering and ""observations"" any longer. I doubt any team lead or manager here is currently an ASE-certified master technician, yet they questioned my expertise.Overtime is also MANDATORY, meaning you can\'t opt out, which was hard for me. They often impose 50-hour work weeks so they can sell more cars. With the pandemic, I got displaced from inside the shop to meet their capacity requirements. I literally had to work outside detailing cars over"
Carmax,1f79doihd3kis000,1,Not a good place to work ,Business Office Associate,I did not like to work here. Dealing with impatient customers and the workload was way too much for the amount I was paid. Rotating schedule it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to balance another job or school.
Carmax,1f781ed27u2ki800,1,Super disappointed,CS3 Customer Sales Associate,"At first Carmax sounds awesome, but after a year of taking cars off transporters,  washing cars,  arranging cars on the lot, selling  cars and processing all paperwork It was a ridiculous amount of work for the little bit I was being paid with no promise of advancement."
Carmax,1f77mnaithijp800,4,Overall a good experience,Sales Consultant,There are some things about this company that dont really make sense but overall its a pretty good oppurtunity with a good work life balance. If you are wanting to start in sales its a great pace to start
Carmax,1f75ga7h7s9vq800,2,No work life balance ,Reconditioning Associate,"The company will tell you from the beginning that they are flexible and understanding. Be warned, it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely a lie. Time off can be denied even with vacation time. If you get sick yet haven\xe2\x80\x99t earned sick time yet? Take a point. 6 points and you\xe2\x80\x99re fired. "
Carmax,1f74mutt031ha000,3,Okay job ,Inventory Associate,honestly it was great up until our manager for our team got fired and the manager above him didn\xe2\x80\x99t really care about us as much. a lot of things were miscommunicated and they would never pay attention to the workers who would just sit around and do nothing.
Carmax,1f7142t5ls7es800,5,Fun place to work with great people ,Sales consultant,"No sales experience,  no problem. They have ample training and classes for you to learn their process, which makes it very easy to learn. Great company. "
Carmax,1f6qkr2b2hijp800,3,"Culture was great, pay not so much ",Automotive Sales Manager,"It was a good place to work. But the work, personal  life balance wasnt great, the hours were not ideal for the amout of money that was paid, pay needs to be reevaluated. "
Carmax,1f6pqs8n7s7es800,1,"Disfunctional, Cult like environment. DO NOT DRINK THE CARMAX COOLAID.",Automotive Sales Consultant,"One of the most dysfunctional environments for sales I've ever worked in. From the time a customer hits the showroom, it will take four to five hours to complete the sale of one car. They underestimate the value of used vehicles for trade, and sell their overpriced unclensed poorly serviced vehicles to the dismay of the customers. The business office runs at a sloths pace the concern for the waiting customer is nill. I don't recommend anybody that I even dislike go to work at CarMax all smoke and mirrors. One last thing., The sales consultant is responsible for presenting the financing to the customer we tout that the customer sees the interest rates and finance results at the same time they do. What they don't see is the fact that CarMax marks the interest rate up two to three points before it's delivered to the customer for approval."
Carmax,1f6lq8h0mu3l3800,1,Beware of toxic work environment!,Inventory,"I worked at this company for 6 years in inventory. The workload was in itself easy, but also unpredictable, heavy and usually understaffed. The pay was garbage and at one point, new employees were making as much as me if not more! Management was a complete disaster. They were condescending, unprofessional, immature, and picked favorites to harsh degrees! You can get away with ANYTHING here if you\xe2\x80\x99re a manager and if a manager doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like you, you will know because they will treat you poorly. You can not speak out or state your opinions even though they say it matters. HR does not help you with anything that has to do with your managers! Only some departments get paid well and are respected.. just know that inventory is not! If you like having a life outside of the place you work.. don\xe2\x80\x99t work here. This place is toxic and it\xe2\x80\x99s because of the poor management here!"
Carmax,1f6lj69ups7j3800,1,"Amazing beginner job, frustrating for competent workers. ",SENIOR RECONDITIONING ASSOCIATE,"I can only speak about my experience in the paint department. I was excited to start, a lot of promises led me to believe my skills, work ethic and knowledge would help me rise with in the company. I have always been of the mindset that you should let your work and work ethic speak for itself. On time everyday, ready to work, little to no mistakes the 3 years i worked there. My coworkers are good people but lack common knowledge and often make mistakes. I found myself teaching them about chemicals the process of prepping and even spraying. I am not getting paid to teach but I still wanted our team to succeed. Tons of mistakes from my co-workers where brushed off, little to no consequences on screwing up. People with actual knowledge and skills are exploited, and are ""talked"" to when they take too long doing something (the right way) rather than cut corners. I was still patient because i do believe the company as a whole is a great company. That ended up evaporating, I saw a lot of incompetent workers get promoted  due to the fact that they had personal relationships with management and leads. ""Leads"" get involved with workers in inappropriate manners. Mediocrity is rewarded at this particular site. I could not waste my time waiting on my knowledge and skills to be rewarded so I quit. Since I quit multiple people have quit because of those same reasons. In fact they have to reach a ""number"" of cars on their build and if they don\'t, they fudge the numbers. It was an OK workplace at best. But if you are lacking skills and untrained. This is the place for you. "
Carmax,1f6khjve2s7j3800,4,Great company to start with. Management was awesome,Service Advisor,I really enjiyed my time at Carmax. My management team was very supportive. The hours were long but  I did not mind.  Offered benefits and great qork culture
Carmax,1f6k6t1pan5f6800,1,Terrible place to work,Reconditioning Associate,My immediate manager awesome. They work you to death and dont care about your work life balance. The most toxic place I have ever worked for.  Dont have all the supplies to do your job right. If you gell them ot takes forever to fix something. 
Carmax,1f6iq7obou1pa800,1,bad company,Sales Representative,not employee friendly.  very political.    the managers are poor. the managers yell at subordinates and manage thru fear   bad morale at the firm     the firm has lots of potential. if the management style improves 
Carmax,1f6h5lr6ko1jh800,2,"Went from amazing, to disappointing real quick.",Sales Consultant,"Used to love working for the company and the pay was really good too. Moved states to another CarMax location and that\xe2\x80\x99s when they started this Omni channel (calling centers) and that ruined everything. The only way for you to make any money is if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything online. If they did, you lose half your pay and end up doing the same amount of work. I used to work and sell about 15 cars a month and that was great. Now I have to sell about 30 cars in the hopes I get the same pay as the 15. There even a chance to only get paid a quarter of the deal if another person ends up helping them. The promise was Omni was supposed to give us kore money, but it\xe2\x80\x99s actually made us struggle to make ends meet. Which in turn made it to where you don\xe2\x80\x99t wanna work together because you don\xe2\x80\x99t wanna lose more money. The managers don\xe2\x80\x99t care how you really are feeling. They congratulate you on achievements in the store and offer free food for the store. But that\xe2\x80\x99s the best your gonna get. When things get rough they don\xe2\x80\x99t do anything or even quite possibly blame you for the issue and right you up. I have never need to call an HR department so much to make sure things are done right. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t know the policies of the company, you will be taken advantage of which is sad. This once amazing company, has become money hungry and gutless place. They are losing employees left and right and making us working and make us feel horrible for taking our lunches when we have people waiting to buy or sell their cars. Also the health insurance is useless, they only cover a little and you\xe2\x80\x99re responsible for"
Carmax,1f6g7uq4no1gm800,1,None. I will not waste time answering this question,Sales Associate,As a sales consultant you are asked to do everything on the lot except repair the cars. No lot attendants to assist with speeding up sales process.  Compensation poor considering what they expect from you.
Carmax,1f6cnole2o21m800,2,Employees were great because misery loves company. ,Service Operator,Long hours with Big Brother always watching you. Pay and benefits were good but the long hours are not conductive to a work/life balance. At least the co-workers (NOT upper management) were nice. 
Carmax,1f6b9cv5pu3a7800,4,Fun and understanding workplace,Inventory Associate,"I really enjoy CarMax. I am down in the inventory department. We focus mostly on receiving and cleaning vehicles when purchased. It's a fun job, super easy, and you are able to listen to your choice of music. Not a career but definitely a fun job while I'm on school. "
Carmax,1f6ajbinpo1gm800,5,Good people and organization ,Unemployed due to COVID-19,I love Carmax. They take great pride in the cars they offer for sale. Their financing is easy and very competitive. I have worked in the automotive industry all my life and I just like being involved with helping people find the car \xf0\x9f\x9a\x97 for them and the financing \xf0\x9f\xa4\x91they may need. Management is very friendly\xf0\x9f\x99\x82 and helpful. 
Carmax,1f692cuo8u3a7800,4,Great place to work to grow and learn,Automotive Technician,I really love what I do and my job gives me the schedule I need to fit around my home life. I love how I have and had the opportunity to grow and learn with the company which has helped me become a great mechanic. 
Carmax,1f673401oo1gm800,1,If you like being micromanaged ,Customer Experience Consultant,"They are looking for just about anybody to fill their call center seats. The problem is they know very little how a call center should work. Be careful what you say to management. There is a lot of prideful adolescent managers who like talking behind your back and then complaining about you to others. The company expects you to follow a script even though the recruiter and trainer state a script is used only as a guideline. Again, did I mention they are obsessed with micro managing? I guess they view micro management with constructive feedback. Except when the managers have a chip on their shoulders and are bad mouthing the technology you know there is a huge disconnect."
Carmax,1f65qsf2h3ocs000,1,Grossly overworked and underpaid.,Cross Functional Sales Specialist,It is a good place to learn about the car sales industry. It is a horrible place to work once you realize how grossly underpaid you are.  If you are good at sales you and your co-workers are weak you will loathe them because your bonus money will become there\xe2\x80\x99s because it\xe2\x80\x99s split up. No former car salesman come to work at CarMax because they all no better financially.
Carmax,1f63puhqa3h7j000,4,Good earning POTENTIAL and a good starting place for working in sales or financing.,"Business Office Associate, Sales Consultant","Carmax offers a lot of opportunities for networking and learning different sides of business. Working at Carmax you can gain experience with sales and/or admin duties, and customer service, and expertise in financing, (car) insurance and DMV regulations. I highly recommend a career with Carmax for anyone with a positive attitude and good work ethic that isn\xe2\x80\x99t sure what career path they want to take yet, as it can be a fulfilling career itself or be a good starting point down a number of various career paths."
Carmax,1f63dft1tnpr0800,1,Good pay but the shift schedules are rough.,Painter,"When i first started I was on first shift. First shift starts at 5am, it was ok and nice getting off at a decent time but the only way to move up was to go to 2nd shift. Even then its hard to advance because managment plays favorites even tho they claim they don\'t. Also the Managers don\'t know how to properly repair anything along with half the ""techs"" and then try to tell the ""functional expertise"" on how to do the job. They say everything is ""Carmax quality"" but their is a fine line between Carmax quality and actual quality so don\'t let them fool you. And even then they decide whats good enough and they change their standards almost hourly at times. Ask about no fail fridays..."
Carmax,1f612nollu1bv800,4,Great place to work.,Sales Manager,Great place to work and they invest in training their people. Everyone is friendly and supportive from the top down. Many long term employees that have worked for the company for a long time. Perks get better the longer you work for the company.
Carmax,1f60t00ldu1bv800,3,Fun workplace ,Inventory Associate,Working here really made me realize that this is a high school/college level job if you want to grow in this company would have to be there for almost more than 4 to 5 years
Carmax,1f6093icho1kn800,4,"Good place to work, depends on the location.",OPERATIONS MANAGER,Great place to work if at the right store and with right management. I have been to other locations and seem to groove together and felt better support to grow and development.
Carmax,1f5u20ipgo1kn800,4,Great Experience,Sales Consultant,"Great place to work, lots of avenues to succeed in your job, great potential for higher compensation. Management is very supportive and helps with any barriers to selling"
Carmax,1f5rj04mto1kn800,3,Fun place to work at,Buyers Assistant,Everyone was friendly and fun to work with. Great benefits and pay. Some of the management cared about people.                                
Carmax,1f5rhgofb308d000,3,Great training poor pay,Sales Representative,They treat you well. Training is excellent and ongoing. Pay is poor and hours are long if you want to succeed. Management wants you to succeed and will help you. Co-workers are good in general and supportive. In order to advance in career you must be willing to relocate. They treat customers well and there no sleazy sales techniques. 
Carmax,1f5mbt678sa39800,2,Unqualified people work above you,Sales Consultant,"Incompetence up the chain of command. Many feel very unqualified for their job, especially the people above you. They throw you to the wolves and put you scraps of what you should get after doing hours of work."
Carmax,1f5k1ark4u3af800,3,You're just an employee #,Associate,"It\'s all about the numbers of this place. Day shift are treated like royalty with free lunches every now and then but night shift gets nothing but ""get to work or else"" attitude! I lost my passion of this place and now I just clock in do my job and get out of there."
Carmax,1f5irjq1mu3af800,3,"Great selling benefits and training, poor pay and long hours",Sales and Senior Customer Service Representative,"The small stores require sales people to wash and prep cars, receive vehicles from trucking companies, inventory lot, and accept vehicle for service department, they do not like hiring someone for those tasks. Not only do you have to sell, search financing, prepare all paperwork, but then run and wash the car (by hand), vacuum and fill up the vehicle. Unreasonable for the amount of pay. Paid by hour not commission. They keep delegating responsibilities and hiring less and less people and require sales people to do more and more to save cost and increase profits to company. Would not recommend working in this environment, at least in the small stores where no commissions are paid. Promotions are difficult to become manager - high turnover of employees and leadership. Continued micromanagement of behavior, uniform, environment and time. Often unreasonable taskings, continued review demerits for a number of issues to include mannerisms, paperwork mistakes, facial hair, etc."
Carmax,1f5hbroe6u2n1800,4,Inventory associate ,Inventory Control Specialist,"Stressful work environment, great pay, needs to be more organized but overall a decent work environment. They do stuff for the team and able to transfer departments. "
Carmax,1f5gnulliu3af800,2,Extremelu underpaid ,Business Office Associate,It's crazy how much Carmax as a company makes and how much they are paying their employees. The work to life balance...well there is none. Work is your life. You don't get paid for the amount of work you do. Especially as a BOA. They care more about their customers than their employees and it shows.  The Business Office does the most work for Carmax yet we are the most underpaid. 
Carmax,1f5gnjm1vsa39800,5,Productive/Fun,Business Office Associate/DMV Admin.,"Working here was interesting, you met a diverse set of people while building integrity. Co-workers were fun to work with. The culture was upbeat and busy during peak season."
Carmax,1f5fglj9r308d000,5,They Value Their Employees,Customer Experience Consultant,"Absolutely loved working for CarMax. I had many managers because there was so much advancement and opportunities to further a career. My managers were caring, amazing individuals and real go getters! They were also real positive, encouraging and always willing to help. I loved working with my co-workers. The environment that was created for us was so positive. I loved coming to work and being apart of the team. Benefits are amazing, OT always available if you choose. The base pay was good, but the bonuses were awesome!! I averaged $21 - $25 an hour when I averaged out my pay per month (which included my bonuses). If you are motivated, upbeat, ambitious and excited to learn; I highly recommend this company!I love their values in being honest with customers and how much effort they give in showing their employees they are appreciated."
Carmax,1f5bqr0n7u2n1800,1,Go homeless w/ out a job 1st ,Sales Consultant,This place will suck your entire life away. Management does not care if you work every single day open to close and sell 155 cars a month. Heaven forbid you show up 40 seconds late on the timeclock one day. That will definitely be written down in your little blue folder. This place was once the greatest job to have. Now it has become the worst. 
Carmax,1f55m3mugu3af800,4,Organization ,Customer Experience Consultant,Overall this organization operates nationally and has lots of employment opportunities. Depending on the position you will be trained accordingly for success. Workplace culture is like no other company I have worked at before \xf0\x9f\x99\x82. I enjoyed working with my coworkers.
Carmax,1f54upsti308d000,2,This Job can Be Very Negative ,Sales Associate,Working at Carmax can be very demanding. Their attendance policy is very unforgiving. Sometimes you are forced to stay longer than your shift in order to complete sales.
Carmax,1f52bm9hru3af800,1,Stress and no security,SALES CONSULTANT,Overall the people are great but the company itself is very rough to work for. Requesting PTO was like pulling teeth. The compensation was no where near the industry standard 
Carmax,1f51m9sat308d000,5,Very fun place to work ,Sales Consultant,Loved the place very fun and alot of customers to help really loved the weekends and loved the people I worked with amazing lunch and fun environment really loved it
Carmax,1f51jdbe6u2n1800,4,Very good company ,Mechanic,Good pay. Their strict and a lot of political work But great place to work your opinion do matter and they listen to ur ideas and opinions. Clean work area 
Carmax,1f51hkc0uo1kn800,2,Company has good core values BUT they are not implemented almost at all.,Mechanical Associate,"Carmax as a whole I believe has good values but with the management they have in place and the way they have operated the last couple years has made there values almost meaningless . The ONLY thing getting people int he door and staying is the pay and if you just want a paycheck it would be a great fit but if you are concerned about having a striving career where you can advanced based on your hard work and work ethic then this is not the right place for you . Training or next level up opportunities are constantly being pushed make or made excuses t o why they cannot be done , continuesly holding you back in your career improvement and with the constant overtime and sometimes unreasonable goals set it is completely unmotivating to continue to preform my job to the best of my ability . "
Carmax,1f500jvmku2n1800,3,Not what I thought it was ,AR Specialist I,"Got hired on as a tech, figured it would be working on cars, pretty small, generic stuff . My first day they had me paying invoices that are 1-3 years old. I was also told that it was part of my duty to scan the vehicles in the lot before I was able to do anything else, weather it\xe2\x80\x99s customer work or pay invoices . "
Carmax,1f4v1t85tu392800,1,Do not work here if you plan to be anything more than inventory,Inventory Associate,"Worked here for 1 year was promised to be moved up for 6 months and never moved up nor was my pay advanced. Management has no idea what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing, others sit in the office and get the workers to do their work for them. Overall if you don\xe2\x80\x99t wanna make over the starting pay do not work here it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth it"
Carmax,1f4uhh0qou39f800,4,Fun place to work ,Sales Consultant,I enjoyed my experience there! The job gave you training on sales. You can transfer to stores if you move out of state. Rewards of food on Saturday because of making sakes budget or other goals. 
Carmax,1f4tknj6qu39f800,3,Hustle hard ,Sales Consultant,You can earn a good living in sales but to do well you have to work long hours.  Typically to do well you have to work 60 + hours to earn a solid living.
Carmax,1f4sq7da62v6h000,1,Worst place no respect for their employees ,Reconditioning Associate,"Overworked not good pay couldn\xe2\x80\x99t care less for you. It\xe2\x80\x99s a company and only them no matter how good you do. Place is a joke, management is an absolute joke. "
Carmax,1f4sk2glku392800,3,Used to be a great place to work. Very sad to see what its become.,Mechanical Associate,Been here for almost 9 years. First 4 years were awesome. It was a great place to work. Last 5 years it has really went down hill. Next level training and advancement opportunities have became almost non existent. More concerned with quantity rather then quality of vehicles. Good place to work if your just passing through.
Carmax,1f4si65v42v6h000,4,"Fun workplace, friendly coworkers, managers are always nowhere to be found when needed or “too busy”",Customer Service Operator,Awesome and fun place to work but managers are almost never available and if they are it\xe2\x80\x99s an inconvenience to them. So get use to working and handling customer situations by yourself. You get an hour lunch with is awesome but the pay is terrible. But the company balances it out by offering assistance.
Carmax,1f4shcttuu39f800,4,Great place to work,Auto Technician,Great place to work always productive and have cars coming in. Associates are nice and benefits are through the roof. This is a great company to work for 
Carmax,1f4sc79k6u392800,5,Fun,Sales Associate,Awesome very fun and everybody there is so nice and the customers treat us all like the best sales people in the game. Would not trade this job for anything
Carmax,1f4mjqckjsa8r800,5,"Fun job, get all the hours you want.",Driver,Great place to work. The only thing that's not great is the pay and rotating schedule.  You get to work as many extra hours as you want. You get to drive a lot of different cars. Management takes care of you and has your back. If you need something just ask and tgey will get it for you. Overall a great laid back place to work. You just won't make as much as some other car hauler companies.
Carmax,1f4kudjha2v72000,5,"Great business model, ethical to both customers and employees",Inventory Associate,"CarMax is a great company.  Their sales model is ethical, there is lots of room for lateral and vertical movement, and the corporate culture was very good (I worked at the Escondido location)."
Carmax,1f4gcbl0ku39f800,2,Cool Uniforms and free parking,inventory,"The managers terrible. There are no set schedules or set off days. There's no clear job role, you work as needed no matter the department. The more you give the more there going to ask for you. We never had enough staff. while struggling  managers would walk past you without giving assistance. The culture within the employees is kind of dope, work with a lot of cool people gives a family feel. CarMax is a good company but they are being misrepresented by the little giants at the store level."
Carmax,1f4gbqs8qt5m6800,4,Good place to work,Business Office Associate,"I worked at Carmax years ago as a Business Office Associate. I primarily handled title work. My co-workers were great, and management was very encouraging. "
Carmax,1f4f9k5mht5m6800,3,"Tedious, Busy, but lots of room to learn.",BUSINESS OFFICE ASSOCIATE,"Every shift gives you an opportunity to learn something new based on the transaction or customer you\'re dealing with.The metrics are highly detail and accuracy based and you will constantly be monitored and ""graded"".Can get a bit tedious and requires highly detailed data entry and customer service is a must.Not a bad place to gain some experience. "
Carmax,1f4f8cl50t5m6800,3,"Fun workplace with good on job perks like lunches, social events, etc...sometimes long hours, tedious work. Very difficult to advance and promote.",Mechanical Associate,"Good pay, difficult hours sometimes. Normal is 40-50 hrs a week. Sometimes they give you a lunch, you get 2 15 min breaks and an hour lunch per day. Strict on being respectful to eachother, which is good. VERY difficult to advance"
Carmax,1f4eb4obbu392800,3,Fun place to work,Director's Club Sales Consultant,"Outdated metrics results in outdated management practices, which results in higher turnover than needed, but not higher than expected for the industry. An example is counting  the number of contacts a salesperson engages to determine close rate, which sounds fair enough initially\xe2\x80\x94until you realize that if a salesperson makes contact with the same person more than once each engagement is counted as though it were a different person; so a person you see 4 times and inevitably sell a car will be seen as you selling 1 out of 4 person\xe2\x80\x99s a vehicle, which is a 25% close rate (hilarious until it\xe2\x80\x99s documented as such).  Just outdated metrics of capturing true data."
Carmax,1f4dlr885t5m6800,4,"Fun Job, Poor Pay Structure",Customer Experience Specialist,I enjoyed being a Customer Experience Consultant at the Richmond call center. The day to day job keeps you on your toes. I was not a fan of the bonus pay getting taxed 35% and if you take vacation it negatively effects your bonus. What is the point of listing paid vacation as a benefit if you will lose bonus pay for the whole pay period. I will say it is definitely a good start for someone out of college.
Carmax,1f4cv88ansa8r800,3,Good place to work if management likes you,Employee,"Carmax has great opportunities, great pay, and great benefits, however, if you are not on management's good side they will hold you back and never promote you. I don't mean if you don't excel, have poor customer service, etc.  I have seen people who were young and made mistakes and years down the line once they worked very hard to improve, were never given the opportunity. If you reach out to human resources about anything, they will speak to you and address the situation but if push comes to shove, they will say they don't have any documentation about your complaint. "
Carmax,1f4cec2mg2v72000,5,Great place to learn and start,Sales Consultant,I have learned a lot about sales being here and am able to earn a good amount of compensation. You are able to learn basic sales skills that can translate to success at CarMax and other sales positions.
Carmax,1f4b344gru39f800,2,I wouldn’t recommend to a friend. ,Service Advisor,"CarMax prides themselves on their culture. But their management at the Cincinnati location is absolutely horrible. They do not care how much work you put in, it\xe2\x80\x99s always over looked. Culture is very harsh and hostile. I would not work there again or recommend to a friend. "
Carmax,1f4aa7m86t5m6800,3,Fast work environment that doesn't compensate enough,Inventory Associate,"The base pay is decent but when I started I was told that we were in a ""blitz"" ( high income of vehicles to turn around ) that was only for tax season. I talked to someone who has been here for 9 months and more than half of that they have been in a ""blitz."" They have given out three bonuses in the 3 months I have been here but they do not make up for the extra work and overtime that is required by us. Otherwise the company is big on respecting your peers and their differences and have tuition assistance benefits. "
Carmax,1f4a1b0rlt5m6800,4,Decent place to work,Technician,"Seems ok, work at your own pace, decent pay, serious disconnect between departments, wide variety of skill levels in the shop, not much incentive to work hard."
Carmax,1f48b5dj4npee800,3,It has it's ups and downs,Sales Consultant,Managers want to see you succeed so they role play and go over sales techniques based on Carmax training. Hourly + commission was too little for max effort put. I work traditional car sales and I get paid more for less the work.
Carmax,1f47ed1tnnpjm800,4,I’m happy with Carmax,Sales Associate,I am a sales consultant with CarMax...I make good money but it took over three years to get to making this amount of money. I feel you get paid what you put in. If you work hard you reap the benefits. In other areas of the business Carmax doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pay a living wage so there is tremendous turnover. Be prepared to be a project manager and a sales consultant. 
Carmax,1f472bqrlu1vt800,5,A professional and structure workplace for all to enjoy.,Management Assistant,My experience at CarMax was an enjoyable work-life that is to be remembered. This job provided an experience that will be remembered for life. I would return to CarMax if the position is there for me.
Carmax,1f42dvjk3s7ju800,3,"Great co-workers, great concept, change to pay structure hurtful",Sales Consultant,"Moved to regional Call center environment instead of local , in store call management, and that effectively cut everyone's pay in half. Still, great co-workers and lots of help across different branches to make the sales go through. I will miss the friends I made there, but not the pay cut."
Carmax,1f40tu514u1vt800,4,Fun yet quite the grind,Sales Manager,"Great benefits. Good atmosphere. Poor work/life balance. Long hours, poor scheduling. Great company but senior managers at store were a combination of incompetent at times and arrogant."
Carmax,1f406a8l8npee800,2,Ehh ,Sales Consultant,The pay went downhill once they started building the call centers. Our commission got cut and they said it would lower our work load but it has just made everything  worse 
Carmax,1f3vvhan5npjm800,2,See below. ,Business Office Associate,Highly stressful job. Always short handed. Lunch hours r constantly changed due to lack of personnel.  Management receives the daily bonuses when daily budgets r made. Personnel receives only the stress. Shift may b over at ten p m but r required to stay until midnight r later.  Covid 19 policies were never enforced.  
Carmax,1f3rga01cu1vt800,2,Underpaid.,Inventory Associate,"You are underpaid like crazy for the amount of work you do as a inventory associate only to get a merit raise, which was .10-.30 cents... kind of stingy to be honest.. basically everyone in any other department looked down on you because you basically are the lowest there is at the store even though we did literally everything to keep that store running. If you want no life outside of work, well then go for it i guess, but other than that, as a full timer, you are scheduled 12:30-9pm and most of the times, you aren\xe2\x80\x99t even out at 9, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be 9:15 or 9:30 or even later. The leads were lazy changing the schedule up for the night crew even though they were using excel, the easiest thing ever. There\xe2\x80\x99s no leads on mondays so you\xe2\x80\x99ll be stuck doing almost everything by yourself or with one other person. Boss wise, the bosses were pretty chill and relaxed, they sometimes would talk to you here and there but other than that, you are there to work and be underpaid for the amount of work there was. Environment was laid back, i did enjoy being around some good workers. Like I said, if you want a job for the pure grind, this is for you. But if you want something that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t underpay you and you would like days off and better hours, I\xe2\x80\x99d look somewhere else. Some of the higher ups were also more lenient towards the girls who were in our department because well... i think you can figure that out. Could be wrong but that\xe2\x80\x99s just my opinion. During tax season, they\xe2\x80\x99ll make you work over time as well no matter what your school schedule is or what not. "
Carmax,1f3qqrbhgu20v800,2,Horrible Pay Plan,Sales Associate,"Pay is horrible, any customer that has any interaction with our website makes you split your commission in half. The overall volume is about 90% web leads so sales consultant incomes have dropped 40-50% in the past year since the new pay plan."
Carmax,1f3p8r41cu20v800,4,Fun work environment,BUSINESS OFFICE ADMINISTRATOR,Fun environment.  Free lunch often. It's a good position for someone just starting out.  The pay was not great for the work and hours put in but the people made work enjoyable.
Carmax,1f3obfoiju3dj800,5,Great Culture,HR,"Company truly cares about Associates and doing the right thing. Very structured environment, but in a good way. The company culture is felt throughout the organization. "
Carmax,1f3o4im9au3dj800,1,Avoid ,Customer Experience Consultant/Sales,Olathe center sent some employees home to work and some they didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Plenty of the employees that didn\xe2\x80\x99t get selected to work from home were denied the ability to work from home while some employees were asked by managers to work from home. Management denying the employees that wanna work from home meanwhile managers ALL of them work from home while telling the agents they gotta report to the building. Commission payout does not match what you actually sell. Avoid at all cost. 
Carmax,1f3emebj6u3bc800,5,It was too many jobs for 1 position and pay ,Customer Service Specialist III,"Give us your opinion abouta typical day at workwhat you learnedmanagementworkplace culturethe hardest part of the jobthe most enjoyable part of the jobDO NOT include confidential company information or personally identifiable information, such as names."
Carmax,1f3dbd89cocr1800,3,It’s a great place to start,Customer Service Representative,"To be frank, the job gives me anxiety. Management is friendly but they show favoritism. Hard to get promoted even if you meet all the requirements. High call volume lately & management requires you take calls back to back. Paid time off is a major plus."
Carmax,1f3bq3kk5ocr1800,3,Not strong management,Parts Associate,"Company okay. A few lazy co-workers make it difficult to be motivated. Don't see much from management to correct co-workers. They look to hire and advance within, but pay cuts come with promotions."
Carmax,1f3a6l6suocr1800,1,Very Unprofessional ,Inventory and detail associate,"The managers never give you clear answers on anything. Its always the managers way or the highway. They pick favorites out of every team and promote those people before they will promote the people who actually work hard. There is no work ethic with any manager here, and THEY WILL KEEP YOU IN A POSITION FOR AN EXTREMELY LONG TIIME! Promotions only happen about every 8-12 months so if you are looking for a place to work your way up in THIS IS NOT THE PLACE "
Carmax,1f39jh688u3bc800,1,Lowest pay for a car hauler! ,Carmax Fleet Driver,"No fair pay even with experience, no benefits, manager never available..he\xe2\x80\x99s like a ghost, no overtime , no room to make more money, don\xe2\x80\x99t waste your time here.. I could keep going ... but you get the point "
Carmax,1f39fuiffocr1800,1,Carmax and integrity,Presidents Club Sales Consultant,Terrible culture. People constantly spoke badly about others. There was lack of diversity in management (All men) long hours. Did not trust employees 
Carmax,1f39416g23guf000,4,Hard work - okay overall,Inventory Associate,"Overall not a bad job.  Work is entirely outside and on your feet, so that could be a downside for some.  Days go by quick because of constant things to do.   Overall I\xe2\x80\x99d recommend.  "
Carmax,1f354j4imhim2800,4,Exceptional Culture,Reconditioning Associate II,"At the Gastonia location, they implement top notch  systems to help associates to succeed and grow in there position. Lean manufacturing at its finest! My time with this company gave me so many more tools, that I continue to use in my job today. The job I do today is extremely different then my position with CarMax. Which goes to show how effective they are at teaching there competencies to associates from the top to the bottom. I do believe that if my current company had 1/10th of the structure and communication that they have, that our outcomes could be even greater.Excellent culture, extremely motivated individuals employed here. Which is a testament to there hiring process. Very fast paced work, with management giving associates ownership of there job; while also holding each individual accountableOnly complaint is pay, I do believe that the pay could be higher given just how much responsibility is placed on the associates, compared to other professional jobs.Ultimately this company gives associates effective tools to take with them for the rest of there careers."
Carmax,1f34ial2v2v5r000,3,Fun at first,Reconditioning Associate,Starting out job was super fun. But as you promote the job gets harder and expectations become un realistic. Everything you do there is timed and if you don't have what they seem as a valid reason for going over your time you get docked. Team lead loves providing negative feedback at the littlest of mistakes. They will thrust you into a new position with minimal training or before you're ready. Favoritism is definitely a thing between associates and management. Everyone there is super sensitive. You let one little bad word slip and you get written up. They censor you so much to the point where it's hard to be yourself
Carmax,1f33l2b0t309g000,4,"Good place to work, but low pay for industry ",Sales Associate,"As a university part-time job this was a great place to work. The management was very nice and cared about their employees. However, compared to what you could make at other dealerships, the commission is quite low. "
Carmax,1f31pm9ru3ki8000,1,They wiil use you. ,Reconditioning Associate Lead,They will use you. Snow cleaning and you dont even get a thank you. Do not work there . Horrible management. They will call you on your days off. You will clean cars covered in d pet hair. 
Carmax,1f300b2us309g000,4,Its secure,Vehicle Appraiser,Been working die a few years in the same role now. Have applied twice for a position promotion and both times either gone with outside hire or didn\xe2\x80\x99t chose anyone. The outside hire lasted a couple weeks and quit all while I was and have been here. Instead of training an existing successful employee a couple things they choose to bring in an outside hire to train in every aspect of the job. Otherwise a great company to work for. They adjusted their sales training and from what I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is a lot harsher and more swim or drown that what it used to be.  Ask the right questions if you\xe2\x80\x99re applying for sales. About 80% of your sales will be split.
Carmax,1f2u5cek13h8b000,4,Brief stay but good company,Inventory Specialist,"Basic two functions either driving or cleaning cars on property.starting pay is 13.34 and $1 hour/per hour if working night shift.Co-workers, some pay more attention to detail on cars than others.Management was down was friendly and approachable.  Work outside in the rain, my shoes and socks were wet on two occasions.  I cant imagine working working 100 degree weather or extreme cold conditions.  Weather appropriate clothing recommend like rain boots, sunglasses, poncho, and so on. some job responsibilities sounded difficult but i was not trained in my short stay there.  IM not a car person so I recommend getting comfortable about driving on busy car lot, tight spots, reversing or parallel parking.  Cars are often parked so close to save space on already small parking lot for parked cars.  Doing DMV runs were fun.  I didnt get a chance to explore benefits.  Most of the of coworkers were friendly and welcoming.   1 hour break"
Carmax,1f2trv4u83h8b000,5,"They really care about their employees, even the part-time ones!",Business Office Associate,"I've worked other jobs in the past where I was a part-time employee and usually they get the short end of the stick. But CarMax is an exception to this. Even as a part-time employee, I received some of the benefits, and I was very much need to feel like a part of the team. Management actually noticed if you were doing a good job and they rewarded that as opposed to just giving everybody the same raises all the time. It was like a family working there!"
Carmax,1f2snlf47him2800,4,"Love it, they take care of you and I feel important to the company.",Detailer,"Since day 1 I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt important to this company and they take good care of you with frequent bonuses, benefits and PTO. Honestly the best company I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked for."
Carmax,1f2item623h8b000,1,Management doesn’t care about their reputation ,Sales Consultant,"Turnover is not an issue, employees come in and  go. No effort to retain employees for the most part. Customers are treated really well, but employees are not treated fairly, I have seen several instances of favoritism."
Carmax,1f2hvd3je2v5r000,4,It’s okay,Inventory Associate,Generic entry level job with no real upward momentum. Advancement is based off how well you can suck up to the managers and on how open your schedule is.
Carmax,1f2ht4sd8u1v3800,2,Over worked for the money ,Inventory Specialist,Constant overtime Mandatory by the company with small bonuses as Incentive to participate to not leave early or call out Highly would not recommend working here it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth your time or headache for the pay
Carmax,1f2hhn0313h8b000,4,Fun job,Sales Consultant,"It was a fun place to work. My co-workers were awesome and management was pretty understanding if you needed a day off. They encouraged you to take your PTO, which was nice."
Carmax,1f2g14qfd309g000,2,"Fun environment, high expectations, bad management",Associate,"Some associates are expected to take on excessive amounts of work and finish it in one shift. You are expected to complete every task they give you, and sign deals and appraisals along the way. This sounds fair until you're given 5 different responsibilities and don't have opportunities to finish them because you're given another responsibility or you're signing a deal/appraisal. And CarMax gets a lot of business, so it's a lot more difficult than it seems. The employees are a bunch of fun, but the pay is not worth the amount of work.  The only way to finish everything you're assigned is by doing overtime, and I have a life outside of CarMax. I can't just drop it all and revolve my world around them. If you want some sort of experience, go for it. But don't expect a ton of respect from a few of the managers and some associates. I definitely felt like the respect level just goes downhill. And they claim to care about their associates and their well-being. But hear me clearly when I say that is a lie.The most enjoyable part is the employees that work by your side. They are so much fun and they're good people. That is the only upside."
Carmax,1f2df0dl92v5r000,1,Don’t plan on having a life ,Business Office Associate,This place was a disaster. High turn over and don\xe2\x80\x99t ever make a mistake. Not a fun environment. Late hours and no flexibility. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever go back again. 
Carmax,1f2belri4309g000,3,It’s okay ,Customer Experience Consultant,"Worked at the cec call center for carmax. Was okay, just felt stressful, they make it slightly better than a call center but it\xe2\x80\x99s still just another call center."
Carmax,1f29b6m96u1v3800,4,"Always busy, managment is pretty lazy sometimes",Detailer,"Once you're in you're pretty much in. Laid back place to work. Lost of money to be made if you're smart. Production pay is the way to go. After working here hourly pay seems silly. Everyone is nice and they pretty much mind their business. management isnt the best and is lazy at times, dont trust anything they say. Always verify. You have chances at advancement but it's rare chances. If they want you in a certain department theyll do whatever they have to do to keep you there...."
Carmax,1f25367est45n800,1,Please do not apply to work in there. They won’t appreciate you no matter what do. ,Automobiles Technician,I worked in this company for 10 years and I regret everyone of them. Is the most stressing place I have worked on. There was a lot of managers watching you all the time ready to write you up for everything and if you are not ok with that: they will write you up for that too.
Carmax,1f24hkse7u1v3800,4,Great company overall but store level needs work,Vehicle Condition Assessor,"The company overall is a great company to work for but on a store level, they really need to work on things. You are constantly on the go. Very detailed training programs. Management are of corporate stock. Workplace culture is fun but when it gets down to the work environment itself, be ready for anything. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep yourself from being stressed out due to the work environment and management. The most enjoyable parts of the job were the people you work with. "
Carmax,1f23l8l2cnppi800,2,"fun place to work, co-work are very and supportive. i can do no wrong if the managements like u",Business office associate,"nice place to work and most people nice. some managements are races and unfair. They don't ready care and play fever on one person over others with the qualification and experience. They can said, they will fix the problems but they never do, even HR can't even to solve the problems.The management will use an exercises to improve your behavior like doing more training and so on, and make u feel u bad, or u are the issued instate of fix it or have some someone take responsibility. They don't stand up for u and take full responsibility for the actions that has happen. they want u work well but dont give tools/time and places to help u success. they'll lies or use an excuse all the times if they dont want u to successful in ur position,if u work here i want u to know this because had to learn in hard ways and saw first hand."
Carmax,1f1tofi58t4cq800,5,Amazing Company,Customer Specialist - Alternative Delivery,"Carmax goes above and beyond for its customers and employees. I would love to grow my career with the company but my current career field isn't at store level so I need to build my experience elsewhere then maybe eventually return back to the company later in life to provide my skills to their IT department. I really recommend taking in carmax to embrace any automotive positions, management or associate work for carmax."
Carmax,1f1sf3dsoo15n800,4,Good Place to work if motivated ,Sales Consultant,"good place to work, Hires almost anyone as long as they seem the fit. On top of that Carmax is a opportunity to make a lot of side money if you know what you're doing."
Carmax,1f1s85rbru40q800,1,It's like a cult ,Service Advisor / Sales Consultant,It's a cult that you find out everyone hates themselves bad management bad experience I've been in the car business for years and the amount of people that have no idea what they are doing is incredible they hire kids that goof of all day 
Carmax,1f1qhkhk0u3hv800,1,"I can speak as a night driver, Very little you can do at night, and your alone, with no help","car transporter, Tractor-trailer driver","As a night driver, your  basically on your own. If you get in a jam, and need help, depend on yourself, because its rare that someone will pick up to help you. If you make a mistake, it will be used against you when its time for a pay increase. You only get one time to make a mistake, and your fired, no questions asked. only a special handful get special treatment. It should be fair across the board, unfortunately it isn't. I got a 14c increase in pay, and was told that maybe 2 years later, I would see another one. Yes I believe that color plays a big part in this. Only because I seen things first hand. "
Carmax,1f1qese5ht4pr800,5,Great place to work ,Parts Associate,"Good benefits., bonuses. Raises . Easily advancing. Great hours . Friendly co workers . Management seems to care . You can travel around they help you with moving expenses "
Carmax,1f1p5dpdbu3hv800,4,Great place to work with potential to be even better,Sales Consultant,"Just like every job, there is always one special case that thinks he/she can talk bad about everyone else and get away with it. Management seems to put up with it. Why? Who knows. There's good employees and lazy part timers. Management is knowledgeable but it seems like their hands are tied when it comes to disciplining those bad apples. That is bad cause it makes them look weak and gives the impression they are to be taken likely. There are lots of tools available for you to help your customers find the perfect vehicle but if you don't use them you get punished in a sense. Its nothing bad but it wastes your time and removes efficiency. Overall it's a good place to work if you have your finances in order cause when its slow, your paychecks will suck. "
Carmax,1f1nenng8u3hv800,4,"Great Benefits, Work Environment, and Opportunity for Growth",Business Office Associate,"Tuition Reimbursement is great. Management has always worked well around my school schedule. Training is a mix of reading, watching, observing, and doing. Leads (those under management) are pretty consistent in observing your work and correctively training and encouraging you to make you successful in your role. At their previous location I worked, my manager was consistently intentional in having 10\xe2\x80\x9315-minute daily meetings and giving us reviews. Meeting really helped us employees in getting to know one another and encouraged us to support one another and function as a team. Reviews helped us grow individually. On the other hand, we are consistently required to stay past our scheduled close time of 9:30 pm because our store closes at 9:00pm and customers come in as late as 8:30 to test drive and buy a vehicle. One manager I have had, has consistently missed giving me reviews. Communication is lacking at the location I work now, and we are poor at supporting one another for the completion of daily tasks. On a positive note, people have always been willing to rally together when we get super busy. I would encourage college students to apply because overall, I have had a great experience. It is a great place to start your career and grow. The environment and culture are pretty healthy (and diverse) and customers are pleasant to work with because they usually have a good experience.  "
Carmax,1f1ln6dd1u3hv800,1,Years ago great people great work place ,Business Office Associate Lead,"Overworked and underpaid can\xe2\x80\x99t keep employees because no willingness to pay for the work they want you to do,if someone quit they\xe2\x80\x99re very slow to replace people and expect the remaining people to do it all poor management especially in business office "
Carmax,1f1lmi3vvt4cq800,4,Ok pay and nice people ,Inventory,The people are really nice. The work is easy and the days go by really fast. Management is ok but could be better at communicating. Good vacation time.
Carmax,1f1gsr977o24v800,4,Ok,Business Office Associate,It was a good company to work for. The pay wasn\xe2\x80\x99t great but if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t like your position they would let you try out another department. You have to work late some times.
Carmax,1f1dsevebn53l800,3,"Respects diversity and never discriminates. You never have time off, even when you are off, phone constatnty rings.",Business Office Manager,"No work/life balance, even when you are off you are expected to answer your phone and be there. Not a lot of support from Home Office in dealing with tough customer situations, you are on your own."
Carmax,1f181ri0rt4b9800,1,Not for real Techs ,Automotive Technician,"Ahh Carmax, I started in 06 when it was in its Hay-day. Great management,  benefits, etc. After the original ceo left, the higher ups just chipped away at the company. I kid you not it became what's best for the share holders not employees. This place is not for technicians don't believe me go work there, btw you will have to leave your hard earned tools at home and use thier community tools. Yeah that's right community tools. BS and back stabbing is every where, standards are not as they where. Pressure to beat that clock, just go look bays have a timer, remember it's a flow style shop. Managers are only concerned with what it takes to keep thier jobs , you are a number thats it. In the hay-day it was hard to get hired on, now turnover is 200 percent they are constantly hiring, real techs will know, please avoid this place. It isn't worth the Bs they will put you through, Good luck to those who take the Carmax challenge ."
Carmax,1f17vpqt2n56c800,5,Great company to work for,Coordinator II,I can honestly say CarMax takes good care of its employees. Encourages advancement. And compensates fairly. The managers are understanding and down to earth. They give you the tools you need to succeed.
Carmax,1f146mvo6n53l800,4,Awesome company ,Business Office Assistant,"Great place to work with Great management, family work environment with genuine people. Not only do they go above and beyond for their customers they also do their employees "
Carmax,1f141vm4ct4q6800,5,"Good place to work, could increase the pay though",Vehicle Condition Assessor,"Great place to get entry level work. I love the company and the benefits, but, working in an hourly non sales position leaves little room for growth, and your wage usually is between $12-$17 an hour, with little change to it. "
Carmax,1f13tqnkjt4b9800,3,Great company if you have a robot mentality.,Sales Associate,"Everything here is scripted. I would describe the sales process as very cookie cutter. There are phrases and terminology that the company will use and they expect you to adopt it. Your job performance is not only evaluated using not only your sales numbers and closing rate but a slew of other criteria designed to make the position of sales person into an almost robotic experience. Have you ever seen the movie ""Stepford Wives""? Management is just as robotic. Your chances of promotion hinge on two things, being able to drink the Kool-aid and having the flexibility to relocate. Job performance, likability, close rate, professionalism and dependability are seen as secondary attributes. Great for a 20 something fresh out of college. Pay is somewhat limited depending on your talent and willingness to work on your scheduled day off. Overall an average experience."
Carmax,1f11agh9u3o8h000,1,Overworked and underappreciated,Mechanical Associate,"It used to be a fun an engaging place when I started but now it feels like a sweatshop. Their obsession with numbers focus makes it impossible to ensure quality in our work, not only would I never recommend you work here, but don\xe2\x80\x99t ever buy a car from here either. Forced to be there 10.5 hours a day for weeks on end, regardless of if you have children to take care of or school or another job to attend. Guys are literally quitting to go BACK to the military. "
Carmax,1f0tqhhcrt4l2800,2,How do people live on this?,Sales Consultant,"The compensation is so low that I actually made more money in high school working part time.  I get it, it's sales but at what point do you pay your people enough to actually buy one of your cars?"
Carmax,1f0silllvnpl8800,1,Great if you want to die,Sales Associate,"If you like getting overworked and being constantly micromanaged and getting treated like a child, boy do I have the job for you. It is a constant struggle of doing what is morally right versus doing what the company wants to turn a profit. "
Carmax,1f0qrg2cb3o8h000,1,Ridiculous ,Inventory Associate,This store was utterly ridiculous. I felt miserable every time I went in. Favorites is a major thing in that store. No communication among managers whatsoever so everyone is being told to do different things all at once. Not to mention the managers treat you like garbage if you\xe2\x80\x99re not their favorite or brown nosing. Overall horrible workplace.
Carmax,1f0pr3t2hs7jc800,2,Different than your average car dealership,Inventory Associate,"As the title states, this is not exactly your run-of-the-mill auto dealership. Yes, the workplace still consists of a sales floor and a business department to run things at the head of the house. However in the back of the house (i.e. the inventory department where I worked at), things operate way different than expected. In just about any given day I worked there, there was something to do to keep us busy (whether it be receiving vehicles or quality checking vehicles before going to the sales lot) which is not a bad thing at all. This however has created a continuous chaotic work environment from which I just felt uneasy and uncomfortable to be with. Also, there was not even a shred of true leadership being displayed from the department leads and managers. Instead, they just worry more about hitting weekly goals and making their bottom dollar. I could not take any more of this after staying with the company for just over a year. I will miss some of the colleague friends I've made but definitely not the disconnected work environment I was in."
Carmax,1f0ot71hrnpl8800,3,Love my coworkers- not great pay ,Business Office Associate,Love working in this environment. Everyone is super supportive and help each other when it\xe2\x80\x99s needed. I have heard other locations are less than stellar when it comes to environment so I would be cautious about other locations. Pay is less than the average with the amount of work being done. You\xe2\x80\x99re frequently helping other people in other departments and doing extra procedures that you should be compensated for. Differences between salary and hourly employees is laughable. 
Carmax,1f0je0iaq3o8h000,1,Unappreciated overworked no morals ,Mechanic,"Working for Carmax was great the first two years I was there then the company started making changes, got worse overtime during management change and company cooperates bigwigs got big headed on policies no pay out for sick or vacation you use it or lose it, didn\xe2\x80\x99t help with learning new skills to become a more advanced in your job to learn new mechanics to move up in the company. Your a number there and nothing more."
Carmax,1f0i1l54kn54g800,5,Established corporation that strives for customer satisfaction,Manager,"Great company to work for, but has high sometimes unrealistic goals. Managers are bought in to CarMax's vision and purpose. CarMax makes changes to stay with the changing world and continues to be an industry leader."
Carmax,1f0h8mq2js7jc800,2,Underpaid ,Inventory Associate,Work is underpaid and management plays favorites. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t provide employees with the required amount of care for being outside in the heat. Attendance is all they care about 
Carmax,1f0gi4ob63o8h000,5,Unlimited career opportunities ,Sales Consultant,Many ways to advance in the company.  Great management team and unlimited earning potential. Great job security. Great place to work overall.  Only negative aspects are long hours and working every weekend. 
Carmax,1f0cv3t7bhiq9800,3,"Ehhhh, nothing horrible but nothing special.",Customer Experience Consultant,They were new at the call center when I started and slow to figure things out. Managers rarely new what was going on. It was very minimal info from management. They needed more communication between upper management and folks on the phones. Things get lost in the shuffle. 
Carmax,1f0ajqiadnpfj800,4,"Great pay, great hours, i like the job ",Automotive Technician,"The job has its pros and cons but the pros definitely outweigh the cons, the pay is good, great benefits package, no weekends! The there is a lot of room to move up if you are willing to put in the effort. Definitely better than dealership wrenching. "
Carmax,1f07ju6jiu3jt800,1,You are expected to be a robot,Mechanical Associate,"We would have a meeting to discuss productivity, then get yelled at that we had missed time during the meeting and needed to make it up. Toxic environment. "
Carmax,1f052dnp2sa1j800,1,"Used to be great, bad now during Omni channel",Senior Sales Consultant,What a great place to work until they started Omni channel.  Reduced commission and increased work load.  Lgm of Orlando Fl was toxic and fired all great leaders because they refused to adapt to new Omni channel.  
Carmax,1f046gk9osa1j800,2,Coworkers,Customer Operator,Coworkers job positions were hard to keep filled. Other coworkers in the area weren't held accountable for their customers and they liked to throw everything on one person so they had less work to do. Also threw difficult customers to one person so they wouldn't have to deal with them.
Carmax,1f032i84nu3jt800,5,Extremely good and positive work environment with exceptional management team.,Cross Functional Customer Service Associate 3,I had the pleasure of working for the Jenson Beach store for 2 years. I can't say enough about the greatness of the team and management. You are constantly challenged and you 100% have the opportunity to move up in the company fairly quickly. The tools and guidance is second to none. The managers and managers in training are always there to help you advance from day one. The company as a whole is very supportive to your life and situations that may arise. They will never turn their back on their employees. It's truly a pleasure to work and grow with this company. It was sad to leave and to transfer to the Carmax somewhat near my new location wouldn't be reasonable for me. The commute into downtown Charleston or up to Columbia SC from my new location would be taxing and time consuming. I highly recommend this company for employment and a career. 
Carmax,1f02ttlhi304v000,2,Retail will always be retail ,Mechanical Associate V,"This is the place where they brag about being a fortune 500 company, tie their techs hands behind their backs expect them to work miracles so they can turn around and charge dealership rates for shade tree repairs and pocket them different instead of adequate pay. They do a lot of questionable repairs, because repairing a broken anything is cheaper then replacing it. "
Carmax,1f0218l3tu4d4800,1,eh,Reconditioning Associate,"this job is fine, as long as you dont mind being worked to death. you have good benefits and good pay, but its such a hard job on your body, and your life away from work is basically trashed. they handled COVID 19 terribly and weren't going to make people wear masks."
Carmax,1f00rc54f306b000,3,"Productive, employees make it fun. Bad management/disorganized ",Business Office Associate,"If you don\xe2\x80\x99t know too much about the process of selling or buying cars, they\xe2\x80\x99ll train you. A lot of it can be beneficial to your personal life too. Unfortunately they will also sometimes throw you into situations/tasks you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to do yet just because they are understaffed and need someone to do a job. Luckily other employees are more than willing to help out if you have any questions (assuming the same was done to them too). Management should work on how to handle time and tasks better. Everyone ends up stressed out and anxious because of how scattered everything is.  "
Carmax,1f006qccrsa1j800,4,Good company,Retail Technician,It was a good company to work for until covid.  Had to change jobs due to get to g furlough.  They did pay for 2 weeks while we where out but couldnt afford to sit and wait.  
Carmax,1evvt7bgd304v000,1,Corporate changes ,Associate ,"No longer a good place. It\xe2\x80\x99s just different with the new roll out of doing business. Not the same. If anything, job is harder and longer days. You discover everything at the last minute"
Carmax,1evsg6t11ocao800,5,Great place to work,Sales Associate,The work environment is great. There is an awesome culture to be had at Carmax. You have the ability to help customers find the used car they need and find a solution to their problem.
Carmax,1evs5sb4gs7kr800,1,Terrible,Receptionist,Not the very best work experience I\xe2\x80\x99ve encountered. Would not recommend to others and would advise to seek employment elsewhere for your own personal advancement.
Carmax,1evrd6uehocao800,5,Great place to work at and great opportunities,Parts Associate,Management is not bad. There is always an opportunity to move departments when a position opens up. I would say one of the best companies I ever worked for
Carmax,1evqrmbu7npn0800,4,Great company to work for if you're willing to put in the effort!,Buyer,Exceptional on the job training.  Inclusive work environment.  Nothing bad to say about the company at all.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with all the different team members.
Carmax,1evo9rajrsa8h800,5,Very productive and good opportunities ,Detailer,"Management is not great. They are very selective on who they choose to promote and do favor individuals. You can be trained for any position and paid. But you can also do as little as you like and still have flexibility. They have lunches weekly, bonus and they help the community monthly. I think the coworkers make this place worthwhile and having the option to move to any department."
Carmax,1evn6ljian52h800,4,Nice coworkers,Inventory Associate,This job was not a bad job I just felt the money was not worth it. The work they had you doing was to much at times. Sometimes we were understaff which made work even harder. It's a good hob for. Young adults.
Carmax,1evmp197vs7kr800,5,Fun place to work,D Davis,"Love the job fun and exciting. Excellent training classes. Luv the staff. Commute is easy, nice vending machines. They really help with your calls and help you to understand difficult issues."
Carmax,1evm2p1tn26a4000,4,Decent Enough,Customer Specialist III,"Decent job, the training and knowledge you receive while there is definitely a plus. But constant issues, like service issues, employees making promises to customers that aren\xe2\x80\x99t attainable, and constant late days. It\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a place that is a great entryway to automotive. But many small factors that make it difficult to succeed."
Carmax,1eum3inkru1ki800,5,Business Office Associate ,Business Office Associate,"It\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty fast pace job; and you have a lot of duties like signing deals, appraisals, and working on dmv duties. I\xe2\x80\x99m in love with my coworkers at my location , so I do believe the people make the workplace also. "
Carmax,1eulrfs72u1ib800,2,Pay cut in half ,Sales Consultant,"I absolutely loved this job when I first started here. Everyone was great to work with and it was a great environment. Once they decided to roll out Omni channel everything changed. Most of the great sales consultants left due to the cut in commission. If any customer clicks and buttons online or calls the call center our commission gets cut in half. At first I thought ok they'll take care of most of the work and when the customer comes in I'll be able to finish quickly so it will balance out because I'll be able to sell more cars. That couldn't be further from the truth, the CEC has been a completely waste of time for the customer. Since Omni started I have had 7 deals that I felt were done correctly. That's 7 in a year and a half. They are driving good sales consultants out of the doors and just hiring people that have no idea what they are doing. Its a shame that a job that I loved so much and considered a career with has done this to their employees. Now we are paid less to do damage control from the mistakes of the call center. We get paid less to get yelled at by customers for mistakes that weren't made by us. I would really discourage anyone from working here, which is the exact opposite of what I would say about this company 2 years ago."
Carmax,1eujg1rkfu1ib800,5,Great Place To Learn,Senior Specialist,I loved my time with the company. It is a great place to be if you want great training in the customer service industry. You feel like you're with your family and the company takes care of you. They provide great opportunities for advancement. The only reason I left was because I didn't want to work 50+ hours in management. Everything was great except for the schedule and customers. I would love to go back if they ever adjusted the schedule. 
Carmax,1eui2jjn3o15p800,4,okay work environment ,Business Office Associate,Most days are busy. A lot of customer interaction on the phone and in person. Its usually the same routine everyday can be tiring at times. We also work on the computer.
Carmax,1euhvqcdku1ki800,1,Uptight management. Don't believe the open door policy. Managers are not trustworthy,Administrative (Deals) Representative I,"Management changes alot through departments. Managers say one thing but throw you under the bus even when it\'s out of your control. They only promote those to are basically work slaves. Advancement is a sham. They give you all these ""assignments "" but you get nowhere unless you pretty much walk over people. The only people I\'ve noticed that gets the opportunities come from customer service to the admin departments. The culture is depressing. You feel like a number/computer rather than a person. Don\'t forget you ARE 100% REPLACEABLE NO MATTER THE HARD WORK YOU PUT IN!!"
Carmax,1eucup9jdo15p800,5,Fun place to work but very stressful,Reconditioning Associate,"It's a good place to work, fun teams good people surrounding you, extremely stressful to work at as being 1 minute late could mean you are 1 step closer to losing your job."
Carmax,1euc9bbodo15p800,4,Not bad,Inventory Associate,Its a decent place to work for. Everyone is very nice and respwctful to each other. I juat wish they would pay the inventory associates more for the work that we do. Especially since new work processes are always added on and never compensated for the extra work. Every other position in Carmax gets compensated but Inventory gets the short end of the stick. The best part of working for inventory is the overtime. Schedules tend to be flexible and requesting days off is relatively easy. Company has decent benefits.
Carmax,1eub9p0mvu1ki800,3,"If you aren’t serious about your career, it’s a good place to work. ",Automotive Technician/Mechanic,"Management doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about you. You are a number, not a person. They lie about getting raises. No disrespect to my work friends intended, but the people who have been here a while are going nowhere and fine with being mediocre. If you want to work your way upwards here, you can only do it with dumb luck, or leave. Only 1 raise per year and it normally doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cover cost of living. No raises for certifications despite what you are told in interview. Air conditioned shop is nice though. "
Carmax,1eua2esoes7gh800,3,If you want to work for free,Senior Sales Consultant,"Low Pay, micromanagement. Like most sales jobs, they will try to milk what they can out of a commissioned employee. You are grades on your sales and surveys."
Carmax,1eu9t6uk6u1ki800,1,Clique of sales people...hard to get sales ,Sales Consultant,"Hard to break through the ""good ol\' boy"" network to achieve any success....and since it\'s commission only, don\'t plan on making money in your first year "
Carmax,1eu1dpe6tn5b7800,5,Great Benefits,Sales Manager,CarMax is a company with great benefits.  They have a strong culture of promoting within the company and offer excellent resources to help you achieve your goals.
Carmax,1eu16ces6n5b7800,5,An overall great place to work,Customer Service Specialist II,"The company cares about it associates, the pay is not great but the benefits and perks. It is the best company I've ever worked for. Training really prepare you do your job proficiently, the support from other associates and MODs was awesome. Scoring metric that determine your performance level is very helpful in measuring your success and areas of improvement."
Carmax,1eu0d9bgvn5b7800,2,"Stressful position, low pay",Business Office Associate,"Not your typical \xe2\x80\x9coffice job\xe2\x80\x9d. Hours are extremely inconsistent, do not expect a set schedule. Some days I start at 10am & other days 5:30pm. A lot of paperwork & computer work is expected in an office job, but the amount of tasks added to the list of daily responsibilities is overwhelming. The hourly wage does not compensate for the amount of work put into this position. Communication is vital in this position, but there seems to be a constant lack of communication instead. Business standards require exceptional input & output. I hardly feel recognized unless my accuracy & surveys are ranked as exceptional. This job heavily revolves around multi-tasking. Unless you personally enjoy multi-tasking & putting down your work & picking up where others have left off, this is not the job for you. On the bright side, I have met some nice people in & out of my department. I have also learned more about cars than I have ever known before."
Carmax,1etu9mr99t48m800,1,Place is a joke ,Production Technician,"Place is a joke. Managers are horrible, they force you to work over time for weeks sometimes months with no option!"
Carmax,1etthb5icu221800,2,Lots of favoritism and popularity,Inventory Associate,"Promotions always seemed to be based on popularity and favoritism, managers never seemed to care about you advancing your just a number and Only care about selling cars, too many people trying to be in charge, leads are never around, no body cares to do extra but only want to work harder when they want something and no matter how hard you work and how above and beyond you go they will promote someone less qualified and not as hard working as you. Benefits are expensive and only dental and vision are good. Once you reach Level II I hope you like doing that for a long time. Go work somewhere else if you want to advance"
Carmax,1etphl93kt50r800,3,Decent enough place to work depending on location ,Reconditioning Associate,"Every store has a different management team and therefore different management style. Unfortunately I have only had one competent boss who knew what she was doing and was aware of what needed to be done. As far as growing and developing goes, good luck. That is basically a free for all. I dont see any system for promoting those who work hard and deserve it, but instead a promotion system for those who complain enough. Its a rather dysfunctional and chaotic place to work. If you're looking for a career you will have better luck learning new things and gaining experience and skills elsewhere."
Carmax,1etpe92l4t48m800,1,Poor Management,Lead Inventory Associate,"I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked for this company for 3 years, and realize it has potential to be great. However, the management (from sales managers to GM) needs improvement. There is no way to check management and give them the necessary feedback to help them improve how they treat their employees. Policies are made for the benefit of managers and the customers at whatever cost to the employees. There is no upward movement, and no incentive to work your hardest. Management takes all the bonuses, and do not share the wealth with their employees. If you want to be treated like a slave, this is the place for you. Pay is good, and there is a yearly increase in pay. But after you\xe2\x80\x99ve been working there for years, and you see new hires get the same pay as you, you feel discouraged to care about the company that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about you. "
Carmax,1etnlp2m3t50r800,3,You're a number,Production Manager,"In my 7 years with the company, there has been a lot of positive as well as lot of politics. There is undeniably a double standard for accountability and direction. You'll be told every situation is treated differently even if one had more of an impact than the other with extremely different outcomes. "
Carmax,1etnbage8sa0g800,2,Bad Management and Long Hours,Detailer,"Currently going through 3:30AM-2:30PM shifts where it's hard to be energetic and fast with work where the managers want us to be fast. These shifts last a while (at least 3 months). They preach quality and want it as fast as possible which is not how it works. If you want quality, we need the time to do it. It gets stressful really fast. Most people in the garage aren't happy from when I talk to them and want to quit. Was told I'd also be getting a raise last year, still waiting."
Carmax,1etkmk4iat48m800,4,Busy Pace,Customer Specialist III,"Great co workers and managers.  Always something to keep you busy.  Not pushed to sell, but rather find what the customer needs and help them get what they need."
Carmax,1etf8u5n1u4fd800,1,Good luck,CDL Driver,Management is an utter joke. Favoritism is promoted and encouraged. Good luck getting a raise. Benefits are expensive and in some cases are cheaper if go directly with same insurance vs carmax. HR will not be an your side! You have no case. Idiot managers are promoted despite constant complaints. 
Carmax,1ete8va5api26800,2,Gets mundane quickly ,VCA,There is little room for advancement and no clear career path. Hourly associated are not treated as well as salary. Shifts aren\xe2\x80\x99t long or difficult but aren\xe2\x80\x99t fairly distributed
Carmax,1et6h9dt8t48t800,3,Management ,Inventory Associate,Many managers take the position \xe2\x80\x9cManager\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor\xe2\x80\x9d to seriously to the point where it becomes unfair and challenging to reason with them. They act as if they are a robot instead of understanding and doing all they can to take care of their associates appropriately. 
Carmax,1et5q18s2t48t800,4,Okay benefits but pay and work life leave alot to be desired,Customer Specialist,Training is great and team is varied and diverse with many different types of backgrounds. However the work life balance is really non existent if you don't work in the home office. Getting ahead and advancement in the company usually lines up with ratting out your coworkers to management for violations.
Carmax,1et2nfqj6u1lf800,1,"Corporate Greed, Carmax has changed.",Sales Representative,"DO NOT work for Carmax. The company has changed over the years and they have become increasingly interested in only providing their share holders with More and More money while creating an atmosphere for their employees of you'll work more for less pay until we have what we want. YOU will be just a number and Management is the absolute worst. They lie, and will leave you to have to figure things out on your own. Do not fall for their everyone works for as team motto people are sick of working here. They changed their pay model so that they can control how much you earn and cap it. You will not make any money as a sales consultant and be expected to produce day in and day out or be fired."
Carmax,1et2fr7r32v81000,4,Fun but you will have to work hard though,Vehicle Condition Assessor,Hardly get a raise for hourly workers. No weekend off. Hardly flexible with the time. Some days you get free meal though. Can't move to other departments
Carmax,1et0nf4u5u1lf800,4,Worked there for around 6 years,Reconditioning Associate,"Enjoyed my time here, always felt like promoting was fair. Bad management comes and goes but for the most part i had alot of excellent opportunities here."
Carmax,1et0em6htnpps800,3,Solid place to work. ,Inventory Associate,"I probably would\xe2\x80\x99ve stayed with Carmax had I not moved. I did try to move departments and was told to reapply again in 6 months, which is disappointing when you\xe2\x80\x99re told you can move around inside company. But good managers who were almost always available when you needed them and enjoyable people to work with. "
Carmax,1ess7sll3t46r800,3,N/a,Inventory Management Specialist,Advancing at Carmax can be challenging if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have any connections. The ones who get promoted have been there because of seniority but don\xe2\x80\x99t have the actual skills to lead
Carmax,1esrja46au3cn800,3,good starting point if no experience,Local Driver,"whatever pay you lock in at the start is it. you'll get a 3% raise after that. People you work with are usually good. management is typical, don't care, corporate."
Carmax,1esnhgaq2t4lr800,3,Everchanging ways has shifted from Quality to Quantity. Moneyhungry like every other car dealership,Automotive Technician Lead,money hungry. not a good place to work.  in 14 years i watched this place go from great to not so good. after 14 years the day i left i was offered nothing. The company phased out my job as a lead technician and i had the option of going backwards or quitting. No severance package offered after almost 15 years.
Carmax,1esj7u68ct4je800,1,Bad place to work ,Inventory Control Specialist,"Newport News site is the worst to work at no promotional opportunities, Managers lie to much or never work out any problems or solutions. Its almost like every person is for there self, there is no sense of teamwork. "
Carmax,1esh30pant4p8800,2,Great Job in sales before CEC came into action,Sales Consultant,"Job is typical car sales, Carmax does give you a lot of tools and processes to make things as simple as possible. The pay change when our store was switched to Omni was pathetic. 1/2 the pay if a customer even makes a quick phone call before their visit.Staff at my location was great, everyone for the most part worked together. Managers were fine, but definitely had favorites and each had their own set of rules for stips."
Carmax,1esgu4qu0u3lm800,4,Interesting perspective to address the used vehicle market,Sales Consultant (Part Time),Interesting process and work experience. Retail can be a challenging environment. Difficult to manage customer experiences and expectation as the need is a used vehicle and financial dependencies.   
Carmax,1esgmt56ht4l7800,5,Constant training opportunities and great culture.,Buyer,"Carmax gave me a shot in the Buyers office, and it's the best career move I ever made. I learned a TON through the buyer-in-training program, and continued to learn something new everyday. My managers and coworkers will be my friends for life, not to mention the relationships I developed through other Carmax locations and dealer auctions. If you love cars, and know how to stay professional in the car business, Carmax is absolutely perfect. I only wish the career advancement went a bit quicker, and pay was on par with other buyers of similar skill level. If you know your worth, don't accept any less, and they will respond to that. "
Carmax,1esg0qidgt4l7800,4,Great culture and opportunities to grow. ,reconditioning associate ,"This company has a great culture, they help a lot of people and always do things for the community. Compared to other dealerships the pay is competitive, and you can grow within the company by learning new things every day, they have the training and tools to help you along the way. "

Carmax,1esbl0ba23ogl000,4,Good company poor leadership ,Inventory Associate,The benefits  are good and there\xe2\x80\x99s some opportunity to get promoted only if you work for the right manager. I learn that you can go above and beyond for the company doing things outside you job title for the company but all you get is a thank you and continuous promises about promoting you but it never happens. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great company but management really sucks
Carmax,1esbj372hs7mj800,4,good company,CXC,"great company to work for, managers and employees are very inclusive to help you succeed. Very supportive company and pay is pretty good however you do have to track your sales because sometimes they will not include customers you know you have worked with"
Carmax,1es9rmop33ogl000,3,Fun workplace but sunderpaying their staff,Sales Associate,It\xe2\x80\x99s a great place to learn customer service but they are transitioning away from tradition sales so staff is underpaid. Very good work life balance and management and growing company as well.
Carmax,1es116c6et4l3800,1,your in your out ,Inventory Associate,This job right here is typically a job that you will get if you either out of high school or can't find anything else there's no diversity just look at the management that will tell you everything the rules and regulations that this job tries to apply only applies to those they choose to the only time they feed you is when something is wrong with you or they feel something ain't right with the employees just to make them forget the respect level as a low CarMax was a great place to work at in the early 2000s but ever since covid this place has been nothing more than a warehouse you die you die mentality this will be a good job to get part-time and unless you're kissing butt and never complain as they like to call it you'll be stuck in the same position I've seen them manipulate people and tell them if they do a certain amount of time and one department they can go to the department they originally wanted to then something happens and they're stuck forgotten they don't care about your experience you're bringing they just need a warm body and when you can't perform they find ways of making you want to quit or give you the famous car Max decision get fired or quit 
Carmax,1es0evfnkt4l3800,5,Fantastic experience! Loved it!,Sales Associate,CarMax is. A great place and the people are wonderful to work with. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I have any complaints. Just a solid experience. I think that overall the company really cares and that\xe2\x80\x99s a good way to do business.
Carmax,1es02ohcit4l3800,4,Amazing for car people...,Car Detailer,"If this isn't you, you just won't really enjoy it. Managers could be very hit or miss and after the initial covid hit, we had been down 2 out of our 4 mangers for over 8 months, so don't count on them for much. Some room for advancement of you can be the teachers pet and/or you have prior certifications. We once worked 10 more hours a week, for 10 weeks straight. So 50 hour work weeks, and received no overtime whatsoever. That was our adjusted week, there was no compensation or overtime except, on Friday, they bought us lunch... Nice though but last people I'd wanna eat with."
Carmax,1erviute43ogl000,3,All depends on management!,Sales Consultant,"If you are good at talking to people, and okay with rejection, you may do well here. The store I worked at was a boys' club, a really bad one. So much for diversity! I do not ever recommend the place to women to work, but I do to men. I did well there too, but management can be a real deal-breaker!"
Carmax,1ers9kvkfsa66800,1,Save yourself the trouble!,Customer Experience Consultant,The Atlanta customer experience center is a COVID hole. The confirmed cases are not properly reported. The pay is unfair .They constantly change the way the bonuses are calculated and take money away from employees . No room for development due to favoritism. HR will listen to your concerns and voice them .Along with your personal business ! TO EVERY ONE! The job started off fun but then then turned into a nightmare .Save your self the time and trouble.
Carmax,1erpge7qeo17p800,3,Fun place to work depending on who likes you,Auto Detailer,The job and working conditions are fine. The amount of rules and regulations they have is quite a bit as a company. While working there I've seen these rules and codes applied differently to employees based on how long they worked there and who liked them etc. Definitely a culture of favoritism and who you know which I don't like.
Carmax,1eronish2u49m800,4,Easy but Unfair Pay,Inventory Specialist,"Management is great! No one bothers you if you work your tail off. You work alone or with a co worker 90% of the time. You get to drive some pretty cool cars, learn about cars and you have little to no customer interaction. The only unfortunate thing is pay and the benefits. The healthcare is expensive for a family and the pay is no near enough to take care of your family. This is a great job for someone who\xe2\x80\x99s right out of high school or even in high school. "
Carmax,1ero7h8h2u49m800,5,"Amazing environment, awful management communication.",Porter/Phone Operator,"Great environment, everyone is inviting. Not micromanaged at all which is great but communication between managers and depts is terrible; causes problems. "
Carmax,1ero2ucar3084000,3,Good work environment but low pay,Sales Consultant,"Good people and nice environment to work. Sales consultants are expected to do about everything including moving/securing cars, locating cars for customers that may be out front or blocked in somewhere in the back, complete credit application with customers and collect all stipulations (including proof of residence, proof of income, bank statements for self employed, ID verification), sell protection plans, sterilize work areas and cars among many other responsibilities. The pay is not commensurate with the responsibilities of sales consultant, lot boy, finance manager and much more. If a customer returns the vehicle per the seven day money back guarantee, all pay is charged back to the salesman after putting in the work and time to sell, finance and deliver the vehicle. The company won\xe2\x80\x99t share the loss or compensate the salesman for the return which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem ethical or fair. "
Carmax,1ermf8jeou1sr800,4,The staff ,Service Advisor,The team atmosphere is great tools at your disposal are good to but moving up takes a lot of steps required by policy.Benefits are great culture is strong but some of the empowerment given at times feels like management is passing off responsibility. Some of the systems need to be realigned to work better with companies mew direction.
Carmax,1erk3v5ivu1sr800,1,"Good Benefits, Horrible Management. ",Inventory Associate,"The benefits are good. Many plans for health insurance. However the management is just about the rudest bunch I\'ve been employed by. On multiple occasions my boss(es) have ignored me and my problem simply because their ego was too over their heads.There is no formal training. They throw you in the deep end. There ARE training modules but I wasn\'t given an opportunity to do them until 3 months in, at which point I had learned everything. The managers always give you a ""look"" inflating their ego and they\'re very degrading. To them, you\'re just a number. It\'s always a smart attitude/answer to any of your questions or concerns. I was lied to and tricked into working the position I was in, because I applied to a different postion. I was told I could transfer positions whenever I wanted. Come to find out, I could only transfer to the position I originally applied for, after 6 months. They find anything they can on you to write you up and hold it above your head.   "
Carmax,1erhje1463084000,3,Long hours and pay is a joke,Sales Consultant,As a sales consultant you are paid ridiculously low wages for the amount of work that's needed. It's all commission and they are finding more ways to not pay.

Carmax,1ere66ct2u1sr800,4,fun team oriented company,Sales Consultant,"I love carmax. I started back in 2019 in Sales and have stayed since. the job is fun. very laid back, work at your own pace. meeting new people everyday and delivering an experience is where I thrive. however, recently with adding a call center, it makes delivering that iconic experience harder because if they do ANYTHING online it\xe2\x80\x99s automatically half commission which sucks because you\xe2\x80\x99re fully commission based. usually with these customers they want to be in and out already because the CEC (call center) makes it seem that way to them. but there\xe2\x80\x99s usually many mistakes done by them to where we have to adjust it store. that leaves the customer basically annoyed with you and the store when you\xe2\x80\x99re just trying to help them. BUT when it\xe2\x80\x99s a full deal with added on maxcare I can\xe2\x80\x99t complain. you can make a lot if you stay taking customers. there\xe2\x80\x99s no excuses for you not to make as much money as you wantalso with the CEC it added a bunch of micromanaging, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it though, it usually helps me.carmax is very team oriented and it\xe2\x80\x99s very easy to switch to different positions working the company. if deciding to be on sales I would start part time. scheduled shifts are 3 hrs a day BUT you can come in whenever if needing more $ without having to stay married to a full shift."
Carmax,1ere5ns33u49m800,1,Needs improvement on description of job ,Inventory Associate,Not too happy with the job as it has its ups and downs. The job consist of heavy work for little pay but as you move ip more pay for easier work with time you can leave early. All associates should be able to have the same compensation. Not only that certain people are treated better than others.
Carmax,1erdrfh9eu49m800,5,"Simple, smart and fun!",Business Office Assistant,"Carmax operations are so ingenious. With many past years of experience in automotive settings, I was blown away to see the ease of their paperwork including contracts, signatures, an honest price that is displayed boldly, the ability of the custo.er to choose their lender, and prices that never change or vary. Trusted and fair people, I LOVED working here. "
Carmax,1erbae1n4sa99800,5,We have fun on a daily basis. I have spent 15 wonderful years at CarMax,Buyer/ Production Manager,"Great place to work, Great benefits, management truly cares about you as a person, Engagement is a priority for our culture to ensure  we have the associates back. I LOVE MY JOB."
Carmax,1eranlgkdu35m800,1,Bad management,Service Technician,They will fire you for ANYTHING!!! They bandaid fix cars are won't pay for most of the work done  and don't even think of complaining there is a lot of favoritism. 
Carmax,1era36fjeu49m800,5,The other employees and Employer beleives in team building and work as a coordinated team.,Inventory RA,This company has many positive interactions with their employees and will train you as far as you want to go in the company.  They encourage their employees to feel free to help with processes and will consider any and all suggestions to help improve the life at CarMax.
Carmax,1er9ts07po2gs800,4,Great Place to work!,Sales Consultant,"Carmax is such an amazing place to work! Such a great atmosphere, and very different from typical car dealerships. I love how honest and straight forward Carmax is. They encourage their employees to put the customer first, and go above and beyond for customer service. I'm someone who knew next to nothing about cars or sales, but their training process is so thorough that I was confident in my abilities by the end. I always felt very supported and welcomed in my work environment, and I was constantly learning and improving. I would recommend working here for sure!"
Carmax,1er9h7mn7u49m800,1,Literally the worst job don’t even bother lol,Customer Specialist II,"If you work up front as a customer specialist do not expect your breaks or lunches, you will not get them. Your \xe2\x80\x9ccommission\xe2\x80\x9d at a cross functional store is a team bonus that is shared not only with all of the sales people but also the Managers and Service Technicians who do not sell cars. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how or why this is one of the fortune 100 top places to work, the managers are rude and do not enjoy teaching you how to do anything. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t work here. "
Carmax,1er8j8cbno2gt800,5,"Honest, ethical company ",Business Office Associate,"I love Carmax outside of the pay and outside of part time employees not having benefits. Carmax is a no haggle dealership and is fair with their pricing. That being said, it makes it nice to be an employee and not have to go back and forth. "
Carmax,1er746u0oo2gt800,4,Challenging and Rewarding place to work,Customer Specialist III,"I've greatly enjoyed working at a CarMax Cross-functional (small format) store in Pennsylvania. This is a newer store model for CarMax and is very effective in creating an engaging and enriching work experience for everyone involved. Each day, each hour, I was encouraged to improve upon my behaviors to better myself. Management was kind yet effective, and advancement was offered to all who expressed a consistent interest and ability to master the competency model.On the other hand, I briefly worked at a CarMax Traditional (large format) store in Southern California. The experience was extremely unpleasant. There CarMax culture that I learned previously -hard work, winning together, daily personal development - did not exist at this store. Many of the employees didn't wear proper uniform, and I was surprised to learn that many of my coworkers there didn't know the details of many processes that were important to their job. To that store's credit, everyone was very kind and accommodating, and they had 2 very successful sales reps who stayed consistently busy.Cross functional rating: 5/5Traditional salesperson rating: 1/5"
Carmax,1er6npavdsa97800,3,Busy,Inventory Lead,Inventory lead. Worked my way up the latter to become detail lead only to find out the position doesn't exist anymore. Going through management training for another year. Inventory is outside 90% of the time. They put a lot of work on Inventory and my associates. Pay is not enough for what we do back there. Loved my job in the beginning and it slowly became a place where I dont want to work.
Carmax,1er36csbbsa97800,5,A good place to work,"Representative, Customer Service",I feel good working here. The staff in my team is great and the team managers are very friendly and would train you. The company is a place where you can grow your career 
Carmax,1er35or8tu49m800,5,Carmax exception company,Customer Specialist III,"I have worked for Carmax for 2 years as a sales manager and then after family relocated, stepped into Customer Specialist at a cross function store. Overall, I love the company and I\xe2\x80\x99m so thankful how they cared for us. The training is EXCEPTIONAL and really gives you the tools to do great things. Cross functional is definitely different than a traditional store, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say difficult, however there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to be learned. If you want a company that cares, choose Carmax."
Carmax,1eque003so2gt800,2,Low satisfaction job,Customer Service Representative,"The pay isn't the best. If one adequates the work given to the pay they offer, one is getting extremely underpaid. Management was not helpful. Rather than dealing with the hard customers, they make you deal with them. Long hours (8-10 hours days) and new Healthcare insurance sucks. Management will cut your hours to increase store bonuses if this is needed. The store was even converted from a traditional store to a CXC model... I went from making above +50K to making around 40K..."
Carmax,1eqqkp18osa97800,3,It’s okay for a little then gets boring ,Auto Detailer,It\xe2\x80\x99s okay to start with then it starts getting slow and you never advance in the company  your stick at one job until someone quits so you can get there Job
Carmax,1eqq5a17esa97801,5,Good reputable company that has treated me well. ,CEC,"I have been with the company as of 1 year. The bonus could always be higher and it may help if the base was marginally more. Overall, Mgt has treated me well and I do my job at minimum an above-average level if not more. I took time off due to a family tragedy and the Mgt staff inside the CEC was more than understandable. I plan on staying put, keeping my head down and grinding. We will see what happens!"
Carmax,1eqbmqn98sa99800,5,Pay is decent for the job ,Customer Specialist III,Hours suck. You are expected to work every single weekend. The stores are open until 8-9pm every night so the hours are obviously long. There is little to know work life balance. 
Carmax,1eq0qsgkksa97800,1,Terrible pay,Sr. Sales Associate,The company is so scared of Carvana they are completely forgetting to value their current employees and have been cutting our pay and dumping more work on us. Associates are not valued here no matter what verbiage they use. 
Carmax,1epphpl5hu35m800,5,"Great training, supportive atmosphere, hard to make good money",Sales Consultant,"Great place to work! Nothing bad to say about company, culture, and management. My only issue was the commission structure. The company went to a call center for sales support.  It was supposed to allow consultants to sell more units because the most of the hard legwork in buying a car was supposedly done for you. If a lead was generated by the call center commissions were cut by 50% to the consultant selling the vehicle. The reality is in most cases no time was saved for the customer or consultant in the store but compensation was 50% less per unit.  Same work effort less compensation. Great place to learn to be a sales person and it would be the only car dealership I would ever work for. "
Carmax,1epnhf7btsa99800,1,Dont sell high intrest loans to uninformed teenagers,Car Sales Associate,"Seriously there is no honor in selling high interest loans to uninformed low income families. The pay is great, but I just can't bring myself to be a part of the very system that is in my opinion ruining America."
Carmax,1epnansgmo2gs800,5,Good,Supply Associate,"Loved to work here. Made good friends and had fun at work even on the hard days, the team I worked with always made the best of it. Bad communication between management and associates though "
Carmax,1epmmoi59o2gt800,3,Subpar dealership - Not too bad,Sales Consultant - Full Time,"Here\'s a very honest thorough review on my time in CarMax sales:Working here wasn\'t the worst, not the best. Great entry level sales job, good learning experience when getting your foot into sales. You earn your way up into presidents\' club and even then it\'s a normal subpar dealership job at best. I\'ve heard before I was hired that there were some pretty awful sales managers, however when I was there, I had pretty chill managers. Know what to expect if you work here, that it\'s going to be majority of people who can\'t be approved anywhere else. You\'ll be expected to be able to work with a lot of stipulations, always sometimes very ghetto customers, and on a uncommon occasion - fraud. That\'s just the market for these kinds of used dealerships. If you don\'t sell as much then you\'ll take what\'s called subsidy pay - Essentially meaning you get paid for that time being, but you have to pay them back over time. They introduced this new phone and online program that they call the ""CXC"" (Customer experience center) which honestly kills everyone on the in person Sales Consultant role. Meaning if a customer even gets in contact with anyone in that stupid call center, you lose half your commissions on that deal (This is a full commission job). They (CXC) hardly help you with anything to do with the customers. I personally feel like this move was to save money on the corporate side of the business. In conclusion, stay here for a bit until you get the hang of sales. If you don\'t mind how you\'re paid here, I\'d stay. If you do, go get into an actual dealership."
Carmax,1epj0uru5306b000,1,Save yourself a headache.,Reconditioning Associate,"Honestly starting off in a different location it was great in Sales. The moving from that to Reconditioning the cars, is a total disaster. I feel like I am in a chinese sweat shop. This place is nuts and does not care about you or your home life. Especially during tax season when they bust you out there 50-60 hours a week. Not to mention, if you aren't in the 'clique' dont even bat an eye at any promotion any time soon. Better off looking into another dealership or job..."
Carmax,1epggg5s5u32a800,5,Productive and fun ,Inventory Associate,Was a good job while I worked there fast pace so time goes by very quickly got to Learn a lot of new skills and build my character employees were nice and helpful 
Carmax,1epehuh4lu32a800,4,Good work environment,Vehicle Condition Assessor (VCA),Has a good work environment. Opportunities to advance and switch departments if you are interested. Pretty good at being flexible with schedule if you have a well staffed office.
Carmax,1epc0s05au38g800,4,Associate focus,Recon Manager,Focused on making sure the associates are engaged. Good communication from the top down. Enjoyed the culture and most of the people I worked with and reported to.
Carmax,1epa3f3g2u38g800,3,Good place to gain sales experience.,Sales Consultant,Not a bad company but the quality of your work life can change drastically depending on who your manager is. I had several during my time there and the good ones always move on. 
Carmax,1ep82mhbju38g800,3,Not that bad ,Customer Experience Consultant ,"If you\xe2\x80\x99re in need of a job to just to hold you over until  something else better comes alone, this is the job for you. Other than that the culture there is nice, but pay needs to be increased. "
Carmax,1ep60bbd02v69000,5,Great company! ,Customer Specialist III,"I have worked at a cross functional store for a year and have loved it. The team is awesome and the team bonus structure is pretty nice. The only down side is the hours, typical retail hours. Most common shifts are 9-6, 10-7, 11-8, 12-9. Overall I enjoy it I just wish it was a more set and structured schedule."
Carmax,1ep1u21g6saaa800,4,Great company but night shift was tough.,Vehicle Inspector/Technician,"The company was great, they had giveaways, parties, food. The hours for me were 7pm-6am 4 nights a week. I had a family so it was tough. I did learn a lot there and the cars were properly repaired before resale unlike DriveTime, where they let junk go out the door with basically tape on the holes in the frame."
Carmax,1eovkca2fs7m1800,4,Decent place to work pre-covid.,Reconditioning Associate,"Decent place to work before covid, but they are a sales company overall so it felt as though the company was more interested in keeping sales alive then the safety of their workers and customers. Many opportunities to advance if you are part of production. There were many areas you could go to as you progressed. Would recommend this as a starter to your career. Get in, learn what you can, and if you feel you need to move on to get better, don't hesitate. "
Carmax,1eovesrbfnpim800,5,A different kind of car selling.  ,Sales Consultant,"Lots of rules, which is okay.  Regimented procedures to ensure the customer is satisfied both in time and treatment.  Important to remember, this is not a typical ""car-selling"" environment.  Great place for younger folks to ""break in"" to the industry."
Carmax,1eosovko8s7nn800,4,Great place to work but..,Customer Experience Associate,"The attendance policy is extremely strict. But other than that it is a good place to work, there is just no way around the policy. There\xe2\x80\x99s is no room for life emergencies. It is a good job for people more settled in life , with older kids and a strong support system. "
Carmax,1eoontd9ku44g800,3,Nice place to work. Can get crazy at times,Inventory ,Nice place to work but at times may get super busy and stressful. But for the most part the company is good to work for. Sales team always comes back to Inventory to add work to your plate that you will be held accountable for which can be overwhelming. 
Carmax,1eoof9hsru1e3800,5,Workplace ,Customer Experience Associate,CarMax was one of the best jobs I\xe2\x80\x99ve had. The only thing I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like was that they don\xe2\x80\x99t pay out you PTO. I learned so much here. The customers will definitely keep you going.
Carmax,1eoocsfg6s7f8800,2,CECs are rudderless ships,Senior Manager,I was heavily recruited by talent acquisition due to my background in customer experience. I learned quickly that most of the leaders at the CEC are former car salesman who have been leaders for a short time. It made for a toxic environment and the promoted car salesmen feel threatened by anyone with real leadership experience. It made for inconsistent leadership and associates complained of micromanagement which was a result of the managers not knowing to be strategic and run the business effectively. Other areas of the company may be the people centric workplace they advertise but the customer experience centers are poorly run. 
Carmax,1eoni9n9ss7nn800,1,you're just another number,Detailer,managers are always one sided they are unexperienced they have clear favoritism to the other managers and not the employees verbally abuse you and treat you like a dog
Carmax,1eolgoegds7nn800,3,Great pay corporate drama,Automotive technician/ maryland state inspector,Great pay and rewarded for the efforts put in. Very repitive work and very coorpate atmosphere. There is no shop atmosphere here just assembly line factory work. Standards differ for individual based on management likes you. 
Carmax,1eoj0qdnvnpgr800,1,Wonderful associates but terrible management,Business Office Associate,"I've come to learn they will always treat their associates like a number.  There is no work / life balance and the management is not transparent with their agenda.  The hardest part of the job is trying to stay focus.  The phones will ring non-stop because every calls is routed to the business office. I mean EVERY SINGLE CALL.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the associates. Everyone is a team player, no thanks to management. "
Carmax,1eoilkd3ru44g800,3,average at best.,Inventory Associate,"Annoyingly tedious work in all elements, expect to work nights/weekends even if you do not want to. Pay is not worth it, I would keep looking for other jobs."
Carmax,1eofs17mnnpgr800,1,Bad place overall bad managenent,Service Technician,Not a fun work place what so ever bad pay roll as well you wouldnt get a good paycheck the paycheck would always be delayed as well the owner wasnt the nicest guy.
Carmax,1eofgnqppu1b1800,4,Fair Compensation ,Sr Sales Consultat,"The company's reputation helps to keep customers coming in and driving sales.  Hard workers are rewarded nicely, but hours can be long(retail). There seems to be a growing disconnect between sr management and field works, as new processes are rolled out. It is becoming apparent that customer and associate relations(historically the company's bread and butter) are being side-lined as CarMax tries to appease share holders as competition heats up in the online market. "
Carmax,1eofapoefu1ae800,3,Good place to work ,Supply Associate,"Great benefits, company is very secretive.Pretty set hours, high turn around rate.Management are easy to get along with.In supply there is no room for advancement "
Carmax,1eobr47t22v79000,3,It was great but it has changed.,Car Sales Consultant,"The company is all about making money,  sometimes to get customer service deals and those you get half and some of those deals can be complicated and the company has changed so much from before and they micromanage you 24/7 and the pay has gone down,  before COVID pay was better but now it\xe2\x80\x99s more work and only getting smaller and smaller. "
Carmax,1eobpl0gms7aj800,5,Comfortable ,Senior Sales Consultant,"Very comfortable place to work. Very diverse, quality products, family oriented atmosphere. LGM although lacks appreciation for his associates and is not behind his team just cares about himself and and policy is not willing to fight for what\xe2\x80\x99s right or back his associates also plays favoritism in my store. Company is continuously making changes to benefit the customer at the expense of his associates leading decrease in pay."
Carmax,1entn3k54u1tu800,5,"Building relationships, partnership with other departments. Learning the why behind the retail industry.",Sales Manager,"Pay & benefitsMy pay and benefits at CarMax are great, they value their employees and take care to make sure they have what is needed to take care of themselves and family.CultureCollaboration with my colleagues at CarMax is key, the team work is extraordinary. Everyone works together and builds each other up."
Carmax,1entk1lvau1tu800,4,Great place to work,Sales Associate,I had a job as a sales associate for a little under a year and I thouroughly enjoyed it. My managers were exceptional at their job and always made sure the employees were taken care of. Great place to work my only complaint is the pay per car sold is extremely low. It is to hard to make a lot of money here.
Carmax,1eno1k5nko15h800,4,Fast passed work environment. ,Customer Service Representative,Work-life balanceWork-life balance at CarMax is hard. Retail hours leave you working long into the evening. Rotating schedule can be good and bad. Location is open 7 days a week.
Carmax,1enllipabnpn0800,2,Worse place ever worked,CXC,"If you like being micromanaged, this job is for you. Strict dress code, your ""manager"" walks the loop, every morning, and is never seen again, other ""managers"" are always creeping on you. They take used car salesmen and give them a manager title, even though they have no managerial experience. They want you to follow their political beliefs and if you don\'t you\'re reprimanded. Terrible shifts, every weekend. Makes promises for bonuses, that you never get. If your looking for a job that you\'ll get terminated within a year for a made up reason this is the job for you."
Carmax,1eniunsrst44v800,2,Work in leggins,Account Management Specialist,"Pros : Flexible day time schedule. Time off accrual is good. Laid back dress codeCons: Pay, advancement, technologically stuck in the stone age, pacifist, "
Carmax,1enhnb2ijsaas800,2,"Store management is great, corporate sucks.",MA 2,"On a store level, managers are awesome and they care about the people. Corporate and HR could care less about anything other than numbers. They push quantity over quality without a second thought for how those decisions will affect the customers. Every few months they lower their standards for the cars being refurbished just to get them sellable. If you care about doing things right, don't even bother."
Carmax,1enhefmrdo15h800,3,Recent changes have hurt pay/moral,"Sales Consultant, President's Club","For 5 years I really liked working for this company. They make a big deal about how much their employees matter to them and I think they used to.  Recently the company has made some major changes; not just due to COVID-19 but that has amplified them. These changes have both made the Sales Consultant's job more challenging, as well as paying them less for more work. Understandably, moral has really taken a hit because of this. In addition, at least in our location, the senior management seems to have written off employees who have been there a long time as though we are replaceable.  Multiple great employees who sell well and are great people have been either fired for minor issues that could easily be coached, or made to quit because their concerns simply don't matter.  CarMax is now the kind of place where you'll work hard, but not feel rewarded for it like you once could have."
Carmax,1ene1ibs5u3h2800,3,The pay is horrible.  Especially if you have a family. ,Sales Associate,The work was s fine.  I enjoy what I do but I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how they expect you to have any type of quality of life on the pay plan that exists.  It probably is the lowest in the industry. 
Carmax,1endpdpdo2v8b000,1,Control,Automotive Technician,The company wants to control everything you do you can't say this you can't do that they have there favorites they take care. If they ask your opinion on how the department is running and they  do not agree with you they will reprimand you 
Carmax,1encsrp2ou3h2800,2,Uncertain pay,Customer Experience Consultant,"Had fun at this job in the beginning, then the newness wore off. A lot of managers that put you down and belittle you. Unrealistic expectations and cutthroat"
Carmax,1enc9qrs8u1b0800,1,Pay,Business Office Associate,"You can be number one in the company and, carmax still pays you nothing. The stock guy at Walmart makes more money than I do. Working in the business office you are under stress to be perfect which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel real well."
Carmax,1enbh7ttau3gn800,1,Horrible job as a Inventory Associate,Inventory Associate,If you love coming into work and being harassed then this is for you. No manager takes anything seriously if you feel uncomfortable with a situation they laugh in your face!! Pay is not worth being outside all day in all weather conditions. This is a mindless job for kids. Co workers all gossip no one just works and minds their business something always has to be said. I worked there 3 years and there is ups and downs but mainly downs. I would not work here.
Carmax,1en9qm8jjnpf2800,4,Good place to work,Sales Associate,Managers are invested in providing valuable feedback in order for you to learn and grow. Very structured and plenty of recognition for accomplishments. I wish the pay were higher and then I would have stayed forever.
Carmax,1en94v26rs9u3800,4,Good place to work for students,Detailer,"it really depends on the position you take/accept. i worked for the company for 3+ years and have worked different positions. sales is fun, slightly competitive and majority of sales came from walk-ins. i also worked in recon/auto detail. detail was much harder when it came to day to day work life. management was great in detail, and they would occasionally bring food for us. pay is good for overnight work at detail."
Carmax,1en7enq2cu3sj800,4,Work hard Play hard,Repossession Specialist,"I worked at Carmax Auto Finance for almost 11 years and made life long friends. Work was as easy or hard depending on your department manager or supervisor. However, overall a fun work culture. "
Carmax,1en6dt8n0u3sj800,3,Great work environment but low pay ,Sales Consultant,Carmax has a really good and healthy work environment. My managers and co-workers were great to work with for the most part. Compared to other dealerships you have a better home and work/life balance. What bothers me about Carmax is how much the company makes and how little they pay their employees. When I worked there it was $160 per car which is considerably low compared to what most dealerships pay- I will say they do have good benefits 
Carmax,1en2k1k6jo22b800,1,Folks make the environment great. Pay is terrible ,Senior Consultant,"Expect to make anywhere from 40-80 per car sale, YES you did not hear wrong. Any customer that walks in with any appointment or has called or done anything online you get $80 for car sale even if you do hours of work. You only get 48 hrs sick time for the whole year maximum for full timers and 24 hrs for part timers. You can not get more. "
Carmax,1emvkmcjru3d8800,5,Nice place to work and great opportunity for self starters,Sales Associate,"The commissions are a little low in my opinion but that is primarily due to how easy it is to close sales. The training is really straightforward, and honestly if you have never held a sales job before you can trust the training and stick to it and have pretty good success. Management really had my back and given I had a child with special needs they were really flexible with my schedule. Really enjoyed my time with the company."
Carmax,1emubspm9u3sj800,2,Always work the weekend ,Inventory associate,"Stay away  not a great place to work,they put you on nights and weekends all the time,and the pay is not all that great.Also they always send you out to drop cars off at other dealerships for service because they can't fix them,just annoying working there."
Carmax,1emtrolvoo22b800,3,Cuts to sales consultants commission on almost every sale but good benefits ,Sales Associate,"Good benefits and most of the employees are good people . The new changes to the sales part of the job have left a bad taste for almost everyone. Commission has been cut in half for every customer who goes online before entering the store. If a customer says they made an appointment prior to entering the store, then carmax keeps half the commission. It\xe2\x80\x99s a horrible set up and that happens for almost every customer that walks into the store. CEC most of the time sets up bad expectations for the customers before they walk into the store. Most reps are now having to work twice as hard and sell twice as many cars to earn the salary that they are so used to earning.  Micromanaging can be a common occurrence, but its okay, as long as you do your job you\xe2\x80\x99ll be left alone for the most part. Overall sales used to be a fun position, now it\xe2\x80\x99s filled with stress and constant frustration from having to split your commission for almost nothing. There is a thing called \xe2\x80\x9csignificant engagement\xe2\x80\x9d that is meant to keep the commission policy black and white... well that does not apply to the CEC. It\xe2\x80\x99s a shame.  "
Carmax,1ems8f48hs7le800,2,At your own risk,Sales Associate,The Atlanta CEC not very clear on a lot there policies and practices or bonus pay system needs an upgrade no job security or growth at the CEC but if you just need a job go for it you are better off in the actual store 
Carmax,1emqlo60bu38g800,4,Your experience with the company largely depends on the position you hold.,Inventory Specialist,"Carmax as a whole is a great company. The product and streamlined sales process in my eyes ensures that they will be around for a very long time, so job security isn't an issue. In most departments, I felt management truly enjoyed their job and the company as a whole. Co-workers were always pleasant, and if not, more than likely didn't last long in the company. Your overall experience with the company and its pay will vary with position. When I worked for carmax I was an inventory specialist (overnight), and I don't believe the pay was significant for the work performed. The job was repetitive, physically taxing when scanning all inventory (I worked at the largest location in my state), and was a semi-outdoors position that work had to be completed regardless of the weather. You can get minuscule raises for certifications within the company that basically shows you are competent at your job."

Carmax,1emnupdoau1ac800,4,Great company and culture,Buyer,"Watch out for some managers being more numbers driven and less about mentoring their subordinates. Pay was also low for starting out. However, overall, great company to work for. Amazing culture and benefits."
Carmax,1emn7ir96u1ac800,1,The job culture should actually be zero stars.,Customer Service Consultant,"They are completely carefree. They don't care about the safety of there people. When COVID 19 hit, They closed almost all the store locations. But, Made the call centers work(which is understandable, but why not do it in a safely. They make enough money to do so). The people did not sit 6 feet from each other. And, everyday we had to call a hotline to find out that someone tested positive for COVID 19. Literally every single day of the week, someone was sick. We had to call the hotline everyday to find  out !!! Also, they had the means to allow us to work from home, but didn't. Instead they decided to hire others to work from home . And, when you weren't able to come to work due to fear of COVID 19. They gave you a point(there was a point system). And, then eventually fire you. WORST COMPANY EVER"
Carmax,1emkousoau1m2800,4,Great oppurtunity,Sales Associate,"Ok pay but be prepared to work long hours with no guaranteed pay, the management there is very helpful though and will guide you to be a better salesman. "
Carmax,1emih2qqbu1ac800,2,Use to love working for CarMax! ,Senior Sales Consultant,"Since they have changed our pay structure, things have gone down hill. If the customer just talks to someone on the phone or makes an appointment you get to do most of the work and get paid half or 1/4 the regular commission. (Which could be as low as $40 for alot of work) Customers are confused now more than ever. The company is doing more and more online and just seem to care about the profit and not the culture. New ceo does not care about middle class people working hard for him. Finding ways to keep business but pay people less is his game! Soon, all sales people at CarMax will be non existent. Stay away!"
Carmax,1emge4tnmu1ac800,4,"Good People, Lousy Job",Inventory Associate,"Good co-workers and leads but low-paying dead-end job. A variety of tasks both indoors and out regardless of weather.

Carmax,1elrncc8uu2u5800,3,Was great,Sales Consultant,"This review is for part time. Things were great but they changed commission structure. My commissions are basically down 30% now. If a customer does anything on the website or the phone even if they just call and hold a vehicle you lose half your pay. We used to staff this position as a rotation ourselves and were able to help our customers through the whole process.Now our customers tend to come in even more confused than when they started and frustrated with talking to multiple reps. You're often also at their mercy with selling add ons since customers have made up their mind before you can even explain things like the service plans. The tuition reimbursement is nice and I do make ok money, it's just not enough to really be worth it. But it would be better than a lot of other jobs at the current pay level. "
Carmax,1elraonjno259800,3,Good company but needs new management,Reconditioning Associate II,"Work-life balanceYou start off as an inventory associate which your schedule is a wild card but after they move you to production you will work Monday-Friday 8 hours a day and have weekends off!Pay & benefitsBenefits are decent and the pay is fine but if you plan on living in the AV without any second job or government benefits than renting an apartment out here can be difficult!Job security and advancementThey promote very slowly and play favoritesManagementHigher ups are helpful but base management are terrible and lack communication, they also play favorites at this location!OverallThe job is very simple and moving up can take time but they do offer fantastic training! Everyone is great to work with; my only issue is management is very sloppy and at times clueless and lack communication but with the help of corporate things can get resolved! Pay is barely above minimum wage, unless they move you up quick enough to make a living."
Carmax,1elr3pfhts7du800,2,fun,Worker,"Job security and advancementThey give you mandatory computer assignments but no one ever talks about advancing. It's really a racial type atmosphere there. More quietly made comments about someone being a racist. I've not been there a year and I've heard it about 2 different people. Both in management.OverallIt's better than nothing. If management cared a little, it would be allot better. Overall though it's got really friendly people. The main guy seems nice. No one wants to complain, I know I don'tJob security and advancementThey give you mandatory computer assignments but no one ever talks about advancing. It's really "
Carmax,1elmf0s2au1cn800,3,The business model is ethical. The co-workers are awesome. ,Sales Associate,"A few months ago, I would have given Carmax five stars across the board. Yes, it\'s a corporate entity with a plethora of rules that are, well, I think that ""overkill"" is the appropriate word, but it\'s tolerable. Recently, however, the company has instituted a call center - which could be a good thing, but in reality, is proving to be a serious disincentive to salespeople on the floor; the same people who are the backbone of the operation - because ANY contact with this call center by the customer results in the floor salesperson\'s commission being cut in half. This in and of itself would not be such a bad thing and would actually be a benefit to the floor salesperson if the people at the call center actually contributed to the sales process, or if minimal engagement by the call center employee was required to justify the split commission. As it were, to this point, the call center is a dire failure in this regard. The call center has resulted in the exodus of many, many great salespeople, and if the trend continues in this direction, the turnover rate will be abysmal. On the bright side, the people overall are GREAT. Management, while by corporate design are woefully impotent in terms of departing from ANY corporate policy, are nonetheless awesome folks, and are a pleasure to work with. I sincerely hope that Carmax rights the ship and does the ""right thing"" (""doing the right thing"" being a part of the company\'s mission statement) in terms of the call center and floor salesperson compensation as Carmax really had a great thing going before the call center was implemented.

Cisco,1fl6vt92fosn4800,3,Great place to work. Ok cafeteria (expensive). Good gym. ,Sr. Engineering Manager,Cisco in general is a great place to work. But always lay offs happening in same part of the company which makes it hard to hire / retain people. Always a lot of pressure. Management tries its best to retain but Cisco has become a older company. Made a lot of changes to buildings / works spaces to appear cutting-edge and appeal to younger hires. Sold a lot of buildings and also attempting to hire in other lower cost regions to cut costs (similar to many other companies). Management tries very hard to build an inclusive environment and have succeeded by and large.
Cisco,1fl6hakugn59v801,1,Work stress and workload is not balanced,Project Specialist,Employee opinion does not matter. Management surveys are wasted as leadership tries to influence the survey to show five star instead of focusing on the opinion to change it. Too many contractors in the company.

Cisco,1fj4jssh6u234801,5,so much time off,Tech Support/Customer Service ,"Cisco definitely not pay industry standard.  After being here for >18 years, new employees are making more than I am as a senior engr.Although I can make more money elsewhere, I had 42 paid days off this year.  The standard is 20 days of PTO (which includes sick time, public holidays, normally 5 volunteer days but 10 was given for 2020/2021, and myriad of days off just because they gave it - latest one is Mental Health day."
Cisco,1fiket6h8t4qn801,3,Overall is a great company.  Refreshed and hired a big number of employees.  ,Account Manager,Retired a big number of quality employees due to company's strategy changed.  Management team isn't as strong as used to be.  Workplace culture remains good.  
Cisco,1fijd25ncnph6801,4,Excellent Work-Life Balance but Average Compensation,Mechanical Product Engineer,"Cisco provides a solid work/life balance and enables you to balance key personal priorities. This is a great company to work for while raising a family. The compensation is above average for most markets, but not the most competitive in the SF Bay Area. A lot of companies in the Bay tend to beat their total compensation package, as RSUs are not granted to everyone in IC roles."
Cisco,1fiak576ssa0n802,4,Good Company but Layoffs every year,Finance Manager,A great company. Fair pay. Flexible working hours and working from home.  Managers and co-workers are supportive. Company is so large that the responsibility of each role has a very narrow scope.

Cisco,1fgqe68sjn5d5800,5,Great place to work and develop new skills,Customer Success Specialist,Cisco is transforming from a networking to software company. They have lots of great products to work on - thanks to all the recent acquisitions. I love working here. The work/life balance is great. Managers encourage employees to learn and develop new skills and are ready to reimburse for any training/certification that they are interested in. The work is challenging and gives me a sense of accomplishment. The only thing that I think could be improved is the management style of managers.

The work was interesting and my team was great to work with. There was a lot of flexibility with work scheduling. I was impressed with Cisco's activism efforts and initiatives to help marginalized communities and the environment."

Cisco,1feeiviqgu3a4800,2,Politics with a capital P plus some,Architect,"Innovation is a prized quality at Cisco however individuals trying to work through and contribute to transformation are passively punished for not doing things ""the Cisco way""; Lack of alignment between enterprise strategy and team executions - most managers keep doing what they want to do regardless of what the stated organization and corporate strategy; Frequent and disruptive leadership shakeups in IT; non-engineering roles - despite lip service are not valued; There is very little respect for work-life balance unless you put your own boundaries up - which is problematic especially as we strive to do better with mental health for ourselves and our co-workers. There is an assumption that people have the capability and will to establish these boundaries. A lot of managers and directors here take as much as is offered without consideration to how much they should take and then perversely shame you for overworking yourself."
Cisco,1fe997ketpi24800,2,Lots of money but it was a snake pit working in IT,Senior IT Manager,"Review here focuses on working at Cisco as a mid-level leader in IT. Most of the business units had a very different culture, so do keep that in mind as you consider this.I worked in several different IT areas. The work is challenging, compensation can be substantial. You have a so-so base salary, but if the company and your group hits its numbers, the bonuses can be a substantial part of your compensation. RSUs on top of that, also structured to success metrics. Some wonderful people to work with in both IT and the business. Regretfully, they were outnumbered 4-1 by not so pleasant colleagues. Not a place I would want to work at again nor recommend to anyone. The technology aspects of the IT jobs were pretty mundane. Though there was a lot of chest-thumping about how IT was contributing to the business success, there was a very conservative approach to the technologies deployed and used within IT. Because of this, 'shadow IT' groups were common within business areas as they knew all they were going to get from IT was old tech that often was years behind where the business unit needed to be.Senior leadership within IT was more focused on power games and gaining leverage than actually developing IT strategy that benefited the company. It was like Game of Thrones. Really! The only ones with strategy where the ones driving for their own personal domination. Constant shifting alliances and betrayals. Anyone that was decent and trying to do the right thing were either shunted off to dead-end roles or, more commonly, given the proverbial ax. Funding for staff was not annual."

In the CEO\'s desire to put his own stamp on the company, he hired senior people from outside, rather than promoting from within.  He lost the culture that made Cisco great.  Cisco was late to the ""woke"" agenda it is over the top into it now.  To the point that it just too much.  Get back to what made you a great company.  As far as the tech.

Cisco,1evu9l6akt458800,5,Best company ever,Software Engineer,"Cisco is a company that cares about their employees. The salary is good and the perks are never ending. During the pandemic their worry about our mental health is huge, they gave a budget to pay for home equipment, additional days to recover from stress. You get proper training, and you have access to several learning platforms. Well what can I say, it's definitely the best company I have ever worked for.  "
Cisco,1evt6g1r0ocao800,5,Great people but bureaucracy ,Product Manager,Great culture and care for people. However too many level of management and bureaucracy that slows the company's execution. Too many layoff in the past that prevent good talents from staying.
Cisco,1evd4psket5ho800,4,Great work/life balance and teams,Social Media Engagement & Support,"Felt like every day at work was going to be comfortable. Availability to work from home is a huge plus. Even in the office it was very casual with dress and a casual setting. Only thing is being a red badge/contractor, that you're very expendable to the company if/when they need to cut costs."
Cisco,1ev4l1a7ut5h3800,5,Fun workplace,Sales Lead,"Fun workplace, work life balance. The people deal is important, great collaboration among teams! In some countries, the global work culture does not translate locally, hence the true Cisco Experience is lacking "
Cisco,1ev0ptfevt5ho800,3,A Technology Lover's Dream,Strategic Product Sales Specialist,"For the tech buff, Cisco is a great place to be. So many different tech engagements, that it presents a broad scope for learning and engagement.  The business politics and peer-peer/peer-management engagement however, leaves a lot to be desired. In terms of job security, I must say that I never got that feeling of being secure, and thousands of employees who've randomly been made redundant on a yearly basis, will probably express the same sentiment. That being said, its a large company, with thousands of employees, so I suspect job security is a bit much to hope for, especially dependent on how you are employed there. Job advancement, there's always an opportunity for an open position, and you're free to apply. I'd say the job consideration process seems fair. "
Cisco,1euodi3slo15p800,2,good benefit,Supply Planning,"Lots of meeting and work, fast paced environment. You need to be able to keep up with all those Org and management changes. Very min supervision from manager so you need to be a self starter. "

Cisco,1eu7i59mvo1i6800,2,Management provided a TOXIC environment,Business Operations Manager,In almost six years the entire time was spent in a very toxic environment where it was difficult to break away.  Senior management made decisions without the support of their lower level managers who knew the day to day.  They didn't care about anyone except themselves. 
Cisco,1eu51b1gfo1fo800,3,Practice what you preach,HR,"Flexible work schedule, good tools, clear systems and processes. Bad-it can very cliquey, sorority like in HR. Promotions are based on popularity and who you know, not what you have accomplished."

There are numerous policies and programs for personal and professional growth, care and support in dire need, and high priority on philanthropy and social justice.  I'm proud to be a part of it.  The company has tons of opportunities to explore different roles and the culture supports job rotation.  However, annual layoffs (if not biannual) has become the norm.  "
Cisco,1etad5mkou1n1800,5,Promotes great team spirit,Inside Channel Account Manager,"Great training, advancement opportunities, excellent benefits, great work environment, competitive compensation both salary and commission provides excellent tools to succeed."
Cisco,1et86n0ckpi26800,5,Worlds Number One Place to Work,Executive Assistant,Need I say more. Cisco is rated the best place to work because it simply is. Managers in the People and Communities Division are particularly fantastic. The CEO is awesome and reflects that values of the Org. Sets a strong example for upper management that flows throughout the org. 
Cisco,1et20b1f1u1lf800,5,Worked there for 20 years.,Cx Program Manager (Retired),The best job I've ever had in my life.  Spent 20 years there and was able to take early retirement at the age of 51.  Everyday they support your learning and growth opportunities.
Cisco,1esoirj84npcv800,3,Had lots flexibility,"Technical MTechn ical marketing engineerarketing Manager, Infrastructure",I was not tied to my desk. I had no set time i needed to be in the office. I was not micro managed but certainly favorite's was a problem. I also felt very unsecure about when and if i was going to get laid off.
Cisco,1esfe3o0l304h000,3,Good company to work for,Software Engineer,"Fair Work life balance. Fun team if you have good manager, Good amount of PTO.I don't like the annual review system that put 5% people on the bottom. "
Cisco,1esf0d8or3ois000,3,Frequent re-org,Test Engineer,"Cisco is a one of the best company to work for but there is no job security, frequent re-org and lay off. If you want to build your resume its a great company to work for but you always have to be worried about your job security."

Cisco,1ervu95u02v70000,3,Old corporate feel can easily work remote,Business Analyst,This is a good place to work if you have a family and need to work remote alot.  They are very flexible.  No one rarely came into the office.  You work at most 2 hours a day.
Cisco,1erulh7dr3ogl000,4,"Supportive of employee's life events, provides necessary time off",Project Manager,I loved working for Cisco.  They were supportive and always had my back when life situations occurred.  There are many great managers at Cisco so encourage employees to speak their mind and come up with new ideas.
Cisco,1ers7ai8l3084000,5,"I love CISCO, but like any other company when financial crisis come...",IT Risk Mgmt. Specialist / Project  and Program Manager,"CISCO is a very fair company to work for.  There are many opportunities to grow within CISCO.  The key is to stay on top and beyond expectations. As any IT industry employees need to be at the speed of the new coming technology.  CISCO is  a great place to grow ! I will always miss team, and friends. I love CISCO. "
Cisco,1erin7rgao2gt800,5,Fun place to work,Financial Analyst - AR Operations Divestiture Program,Cisco truly is the best place to work. They value you as a person and employee. There is opportunity for growth.  The perks are great. It is also the little things like ice cream socials in the Cafe that makes it so nice to work there.
Cisco,1eqtam1uqo2gs800,3,One time Wall Street darling has lost its luster,"Senior Manager, Finance","Cisco was a one time Wall Street darling and had a great start up culture up until 2000. After that, the work hard play hard culture was lost. Even after being consistently ranked Exceeds Expectations, in the 15 years I spent there, I got promoted only once. I did learn a lot as I got exposure to various functions within Finance. The initial years between 1992 and 1999 were very rewarding. Later, there were lay offs every year and it wasnt clear how the employees to be laid off were selected. While I was not laid off, it appeared there was no scope for growth for me - so I left for a significantly better opportunity with another company."
Cisco,1eql1h8a5u35m800,4,Great Place To Work & Grow,GSTS Analyst,Unfortunately was laid off in August due to covid. But while there everyone was great to work with. Work Life balance was great. Would absolutely work there again!

Cisco,1eqdtc207o2gs800,4,Excellent company to work,System Engineer,"Excellent company to work with, great team, and team working culture. One will get some chances to involve in new innovations and technologies which could be a great enhancement in professional growth.As you care more about the company, they care more about you."
Cisco,1eoig8ufps7nn800,3,Good,Finance Analyst,"Work life balance in finance not as good as other organizations.  However, inclusive culture is and flexible/remote work is a big bonus. Hard to move up within your current job, need to move out to be promoted."
Cisco,1eoifvjkvnpgr800,1,way too much politics,Software Engineer,The people left at this company are hellbent on playing the political game while doing absolutely nothing. I can only imagine if they put 1% of the effort they put into sucking up to the managers into productive work
Cisco,1eoe91eegnq2t800,4,Stable Company with Good Work/Life Balance ,Senior Product Manager,I worked for Cisco for 7+ years. The company has a healthy work/life balance and the people are generally supportive. There are various interesting projects and generally you have the mobility/flexibility to contribute and make some marks based on your expertise. There are many opportunities to grow and/or to experience different roles within various divisions or business units. 
Cisco,1eo1n9eognppl800,1,Management was very demanding and degrading Not encouraging actually more devaluation ,Senior Technical Recruiter,Very difficult and no work life balance. Seemed very difficult to please management. Should have given an iv so we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need to eat Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t work from home. 12 to 16 hours a day total burnout.Asked for a day off when a friend was in town got no for an answer No time off more then a couple years 
Cisco,1enoe33aeu2d6800,1,Most start out as contact employees ,Executive Assistant,"Most people start out as contact employees and layoffs are frequent. Contract employees are the first to go.  In fact, they hire mostly contract employees and find ways to keep them as contract employees longer than is normally allowed, knowing that another layoff is coming and that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be the first on the chopping block. People are expected to stay as contract employees for at least a year but I\xe2\x80\x99ve know people who were contact for more than three years. "
Cisco,1enmg4tlat44v800,3,Politics Maganetic,Senior Engineer,"Stressful environment, a lot of politics, lower level of management is not good, a lot of people are not doing the best they can and only hang there for get pay check"
Cisco,1en6ih6fku3sj800,5,Productive work environment with interesting projects,Software Engineer Intern,Worked on an interesting application that taught me many different skills. Developers and management were also very supportive and the company seemed to be a fulfilling place to work at. 
Cisco,1en13mak1t51u800,5,Excellent hardware company struggling to be a software company,Solution Architect,"For their early history, Cisco made the best network gear, hands down. But then they tried to shoehorn this ""Linux"" thing into their routers and all heII broke loose. Now there\'s three or four different platforms, all with similar and different flaws. On top of that they try to buy tech companies with the expectation of rolling that ""new tech"" into their products but unless they just slap a ""Cisco"" label on it, very little tech seems to be so earth-shattering that the warring engineering teams can ever consolidate and make great gear once again.The engineers are mind-blowing smart and the folks you work with day to day are the best you\'ll probably chance to meet. The projects you work on are usually very exciting if you\'re a problem solver.Touchy-feely HR now requires diversity training for one of the most internally diverse companies in existence. Go figure. Gives to all the ""causes du jour"" so take that as a warning/guarantee. Great benefits for making sure your work life balance is met."
Cisco,1em3nk057o259800,4,Collaborative ,Sr. Manager,Good company to work for. Strong team culture. Leader check ins are great. Caring company and strong stance on social justice. Good benefits andsuper supportive of employees during COVID-19
Cisco,1em2ios75s7du800,3,Very good employee resources and benefits.  Oversized middle and lower management impede productivity and growth. ,IT Architect,"Very good employee resources and benefits.  Best technology to work both remotely and at work. Too many middle and lower-level managers competing for their own careers without any regard for their teams.  Reward and growth are based on sycophancy, performance has` no value."
Cisco,1elvcdgg8u2u5800,3,Nice job,HR Consultant,Cisco is a nice place to work but dont get too comfortable. You will either get laid off or become complacent. There is often talk about diversity and inclusion but none of it seems genuine. 
Cisco,1elo4ogslnpcn800,3,Major Decline,Sr. Manager,"Unfortunately, Cisco is experiencing the downward slide that most large companies eventually face if they do not remain relevant in the technology sector.  While our HR leadership is focused on meditation and feel-good ideas, the rest of our company wonders when we will get back to the business of making money.  We are impacting huge numbers in our workforce and the folks who are left are expected to pick of the pieces and carry on like nothing happened.  Touchy-feely personas won't help when your workload increase 2x or 3x.  It's time to switch out the exec leadership and get Cisco moving in the right direction.  The CFO and head of Engineering could already see the decline and parted before the ugliness was obvious."
Cisco,1elo3m1bgu2j4800,3,"It has been quite a while, so this is old news","Sr. Manager, Software Sourcing & Supply Chain Management","I spent 17 years at Cisco as a mid-level manager as well as individual contributor SME.  Good: crazy smart people with passion; very cool tech and applications.  Solid compensation.  I was able to work remotely 3 days a week for 5 years and fully remote for 6 more.  San Jose centric focus broke that streak.Bad: became a political organization and lost its way on strategy.  Seems to be recovering a bit, but Cisco really never seemed to come all the way back after the Dot-Com Crash. San Jose centric for a global company."
Cisco,1eljqae4fnq3q800,4,"Respect for diversity, work/life balance, good benefits, transparent culture",Supply Chain Program Manager,"I worked in Supply Chain:Respect for diversity - as an international supply chain, we have team members from all over the world. The company highly respects this diversity. Things like ""Black Lives Matter"" are respected and discussed in company-wide meetings.  There is also a wide range of employee ages and life circumstances.Work/life balance - we would sometimes have early or late meetings due to the nature of the job.  But it is okay to take off during the day if needed. There is also a ""Time to Give"" program for volunteer work.Benefits - typical large company with excellent health care, PTO time, and for certain campuses, on-site medical, dental and vision services."
Cisco,1elh6ss7tu2j4800,3,So much redundancy ,Technical Operations Manager,"Teams and people working on same projects and don\xe2\x80\x99t know it.  The practice of acquisitions eats into productivity, creativity and innovation. Too many VPs and they are not on the same page.  "
Cisco,1elbqqd98npcn800,4,Great place to work,Coordinator,Cisco is a great place to work. Many managers are very helpful and understand the pain points of the position. One pain point is that data is often hard to find.
Cisco,1el9dvn2lnpcn800,3,Cisco missed the cloud revolution.,IT Engineer,Cisco does not innovate like Google or Amazon.  Cisco's answer to innovation is buy up smaller companies and hope they hit the next big thing.  Cisco missed the cloud revolution because they did not invest in it and there are not any small companies that can afford to spend the money on cloud like Amazon and Google did.
Cisco,1eks442r0nph9800,3,Remove the flaff,Technical Architect,A lot of good things possible if you are able to remove all the extra flab thats grown around the company over a period of years . Technical talent needs to be appreciated more for the company to grow
Cisco,1ekp2ob77sabu800,4,"Good work life balance, limited growth opportunity",Software Engineering Manager,Work life balance is good but growth opportunities are very limited - esp if u are not in SJC. Frequent management changes and direction changes cause stress and yearly LR can impact anyone.
Cisco,1ejv3butfsa4h800,5,Amazing culture and opportunities for advancement,Financial Analyst,Cisco is very intentional about the culture they are creating throughout all levels of leadership. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very inclusive working environment. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a lot of flexibility and work/life balance. The benefits are very good. They care about investing in their employees to grow talent from within. Rotating to different roles within the organization is also heavily promoted. Almost all of the managers are great people leaders.
Cisco,1ejqftj3qu2v7800,4,Work and advancements,Help Desk Support,"Work is easy and steady, but advancement is slow or none existent due to the ladder effect, or teams being not easily interchanged due to not wanting to train new hires and only get people that know the work for subpar compensation. Also the use of contract workers instead of just hiring them is upsetting, as it will have the tendency to make it so you never are really a cisco employee just a contractor that can be replaced."
Cisco,1ejiv9dm8u1l6800,1,"Pays well, poor environment in CX",Customer Success,"Stay away from CX!!!  Poor leadership to the top.  Lots of great people in Cisco but you have to find them.  At least yearly RIFs, work/life balance is tough to maintain.  It all boils down to who you work for.  But CX is still a mess almost 2 years after they blew up the whole thing and started over."

I hope to have the opportunity to be a direct hire.The people are good, willing to help with any questions you have.  The culture is positive and fun.  Work can become stressful, but it's acceptable for what you do.  Managers look out for you, help you grow, and offer help when you are struggling.

Cisco,1eie7edmlsqbl800,4,A great place to work,"Global Account Manager, NY Enterprise","Cisco is a fun, fast-paced work environment that encourages thinking big and giving back.  The sales organization is high-performing, inclusive but demanding.  It is becoming increasingly early-in-career friendly as Cisco transitions to being a software company rather than the legacy HW-driven firm it has been since 1985.  There are fantastic benefits - healthcare, days off/PTO, time to give back/volunteer - and employee organizations that make it extremely easy for one to find their ""place"" within the firm."

Unfortunately only about 50% of the employees can access benefits like healthcare and PTO.  The remainder are contract employees that are often left without insurance or the ability to take paid time off.  Access to educational opportunities are also limited to contract employees."

Cisco,1eibi227lu1dj800,1,Cisco is a big technology company that grew way to fast.,Program Manager,my job was extremely boring. Most days I would just sit around and watch videos all day to past the time.

Cisco,1ei5dah29r6jn800,2,It was okay I guess,Software Engineer,I liked it but the management wasn't very helpful with what they wanted from me. One day they would say to do something and then later that day they would act like I wasn't supposed to being what they told me to do.

Cisco,1egjpokfo3cfd000,5,Blue or Red badge,Technical Consultant Engineer,"Most cases everyone would start as a red badge if your new to the company. Red badges are often contract position. It is not guarantee that you may get an offer within 6 months and not even 10 months. Best to work hard, learn harder, and communicate with your teammates. Cisco is the best thing that has happen to me but since I\xe2\x80\x99m only a contractor, permanent work is not necessarily gonna happen. Good thing is you can apply to blue badge aka permanent roles but keep in mind that you might want to stay with the team at least a year before you start applying. "

Cisco,1efvf88ppbfgm800,4,Highly competitive but supportive.,Project Manager/Consultant,Great management team who were responsive.

Cisco,1efk5kbuer572800,5,Good job great people ,Project Manager,I was offered this position as a contractor. The job was pretty good but I wish I had more time under my contract to learn more valuable skills. Everyone at this location was very friendly and I wish them all the best. 
Cisco,1efeu5qs6p171800,2,"Flexible hours, plenty of comp time.",Network Consulting Engineer,"Like everything else, there's the good, the bad, and the ugly. First, the good; work hours are flexible and the company really strive to provide the feeling of inclusiveness.The Bad; some groups are overworked and over stressed while some others hardly do any work as they lack the skills or lacks drive. So the ones that are very motivated gets burned out quickly.The Ugly; Managers have too many reports and they rarely know what is actually going on with their reports. Most of the team meetings are like just a canned speech but nothing rarely gets fixed. Also, people with skills are despised upon even with very high integrity with keeping customers happy in mind. Constant rotation of temporary workers isn't helping either as they cannot just swoop in and sell the Brand like Blue Badged employees. Most come to Cisco to get it on their resume; then they leave at the right opportune time if they don't get converted from Red to Blue Badge but then they know and does make more money elsewhere."

Cisco,1eepkkntjq359800,2,Cut throat high pressure environment,TELEPRESENCE NETWORK ADMINISTRATOR,"On a typical day as a TelePresence engineer you will connect your laptop to your docking station and begin to search for tickets out of a large virtual bin. If you are a night shift employee there will be no reasonably solvable tickets because the day shift will have already picked the ""low-hanging fruit"". You are expected to solve/ close a set number of tickets per day, which isn\'t always possible.You will receive inbound calls. As a ""triage"" specialist, you will receive everything from quite simple fixes to descriptions of situations that seem like they are in a foreign language. And in fact, you will have many calls from other countries. Then it is your job to either solve the problem or pass it to the next tier, which will not be easy as there is always push back from the higher tiers. You are also expected to study more Cisco theory for one hour each day.The managers were arrogant and aggressive. I watched the manager of the NOC literally prop one leg on a chair and berate an engineer in front of everyone over an issue that was a bad customer and clearly beyond the engineer\'s control. On day shift you will have three immediate bosses -- a tier 2 engineer, a lead, and the overall manager. On nights you will only have two until the two overlapping morning hours.Your solutions and notes are graded. Once a week someone will come and berate your for each ""mistake"" that you made.

The work was challenging and my peers and management were supportive. That said, Cisco is not somewhere you should go expecting to have a career. You\xe2\x80\x99re effectively a hired gun. The annual RIFs are a drain on productivity as everyone starts wondering March - July every year. Departments are given a financial target and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what your performance is. In fact, they don\xe2\x80\x99t even do reviews anymore."

Depending on the group, you can have a lot of smart/talented people, and the work can be interesting. However, work can also be repetitive, and trying to switch to something new is incredibly hard. There's not enough people for the work with too many products in pipeline, resulting in products getting cut/sidelined in favor of others.

There is a lot of favoritism and discrimination resulting in where promotions are given only to the employees who are like them or who are in their club. Some of the managers have created a subservient mentality (be a bag career) and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be part of that. Furthermore, they will ask for feedback and if it\xe2\x80\x99s not what they like, you get penalized or sidelined. Moral is so low and it is a \xe2\x80\x9cdog-eat-dog\xe2\x80\x9d world. If Cisco is to compete in the market, the culture that exist has to change from top down ASAP or it won\xe2\x80\x99t survive. There is a lot of money spent on pet projects and to give RSUs and promotions to the ELT and SLT folks but not enough to give a merit increase or promotions to the folks who put the company first and deliver results day in day out.

Overall promotes great work culture, diverse, cares about community & giving back. Competitive salary and benefits. Depending on manager/group may be able to get promoted and progress career. Lots of good people overall but see con's below.\r Cons: Most cons have to do with the group/organization you work under. Over the years it's disappointing that the management and leadership are eroding and there is little to no notice from top executives. Some groups have become very ego and self-motivated with little to no regard for the teams underneath. Some have inherited or were appointed lucky spots vs truly earning positions and there is heavy political and power plays in motion. Many of these orgs manage by favoritism and those who conform to their self-promotion and endorse egos. Think of working hard and giving away for others to take credit. If you don't do this you will be earmarked to disappear or you should plan to get out. Most of this is *widely* known by other groups within Cisco so make sure you ask around if you are considering a job before you get yourself stuck. Mktg structure and setup changes at least every 2-3 years with on-going changes and layoffs all the time. Momentum is constantly killed by this. Also challenging in marketing is the numerous processes and hand-off in between groups. Seriously kills flow and the opportunity to be innovative. Stock has been stuck in the dumps for way too long.

This is impacting morale across organizations. \r Excessive flexible working hours, people start to leave at 3 pm or come to work after 10 am. Things can drag from days to weeks.
